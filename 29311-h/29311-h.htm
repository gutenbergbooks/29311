<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p>The author of the tales contained in this volume
was one of the brightest and most poetic spirits
who have appeared in Ireland in the last half
century. It is needless to say that he was also
one of the most patriotic Irishmen of his generation&ndash;&ndash;patriotic
in the highest and widest sense of
that term, loving with an ardent love his country,
its people, its historic traditions, its hills and plains,
its lakes and streams, its raths and mounds. Like
all men of his type, he lived largely in the past,
and his fancy revelled much in fairy scenes of
childhood and youth.</p>
<p>The distractions of political life, into which he
entered with characteristic enthusiasm, prevented
Edmund Leamy from cultivating his favourite
field of literature with that assiduity and sustained
application necessary for the purpose of bringing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
out the really great intellectual powers with which
he was endowed; otherwise, he would certainly
have left to Ireland a large body of literature which
would have been the delight of old and young.
But in this volume he has given at least an indication
of what he was capable of doing towards
that end. No one can read these pages without
feeling the charm of a fine and delicate fancy, a
rare power of poetic expression, and a genuinely
Irish instinct; without feeling also an intense regret
that the mind and heart from which they proceeded
were stilled in death long before the powers
of his genius could have been exhausted.</p>
<p>To myself, as one of the most intimate friends
of Edmund Leamy, it is a melancholy pleasure to
have the privilege of writing these few words of
introduction to a volume which, for the purpose
of preserving his memory amongst his countrymen,
needs no introduction at all. The claims of a
long friendship, the knowledge of as stainless a
life as has ever been lived, and admiration for
moral and intellectual endowments of the rarest
character, render it easy to praise. But I do not
think that I indulge in undue expectation in predicting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_ix' name='page_ix'></a>ix</span>
that the new audience to which this volume
will come will rise from its perusal with something
of the feelings of love, admiration, and regret which
those who knew Edmund Leamy personally will
ever cherish in their hearts.</p>

<h2>NOTE.</h2>
</div>
<p>When the friends of the late Edmund Leamy
were considering ways of honouring his memory
they agreed that one way should be to republish
this little book of Irish fairy tales. They knew
that nothing would have been more grateful to
himself, and that, in a manner, it would be an act
of justice to his remarkable gifts. It would introduce
a characteristic specimen of Leamy&#8217;s work
to a race of readers who have appeared since it
was written and who ought to be in a mood more
appreciative of such literature than the mood
which prevailed in that day. For the book has
long been out of print. These &#8220;Irish Fairy Tales&#8221;
were written, and printed on Irish paper, and
published through an Irish publisher&ndash;&ndash;Leamy
would not bring out a book in any other way&ndash;&ndash;before
the Celtic renaissance had arrived. This is one
of the facts which make them interesting. Perhaps,
as some would tell us, seventeen years ago was a
benighted time; at any rate we must admit it was
rather dark from an Irish literary, or even &#8220;Irish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xii' name='page_xii'></a>xii</span>
Ireland,&#8221; point of view. It was before the Gaelic
movement, and before we had such things as
&#8220;intellectuals&#8221; and the &#8220;economic man,&#8221; or even
the Irish Literary Theatre. Leamy&#8217;s gentle and
loyal soul could have taken no influence from the
asperity of some of the intervening ferment,
&#8220;Parliamentarian&#8221; though he was. Had the
impulse to write this volume come to him in this
later period he would only have drawn from the
time the nourishment which the atmosphere of
sympathy always brings to the artist. But the
impulse came to him before this period, in an atmosphere
which held little that could nourish the
sentiment so abundant among us to-day. O&#8217;Curry&#8217;s
and Dr. Joyce&#8217;s books were almost the only sources
of Gaelic inspiration open to a writer who was not
a professed student. Douglas Hyde, though always
at work, had not yet brought the fruits of his researches
to light; Miss Eleanor Hull had not
collected into a handy volume the materials of
&#8220;The Cuchullin Saga&#8221;; Kuno Meyer we did not
know; Standish O&#8217;Grady, though he had published
his &#8220;Heroic Period,&#8221; had not yet begun
popularising the bardic tales in such volumes as
&#8220;Finn and his Companions.&#8221; No one was reading
anything about Ireland but political matter. I
think one may fairly claim some respect from this
later day for a writer who seventeen years ago, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xiii' name='page_xiii'></a>xiii</span>
his own motion, with scarce a word of <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'encourage ment' over line break">encouragement</ins>
save from his wife and a friend or two&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
only one friend&ndash;&ndash;turned to our Gaelic past
and strove to give to Irish children something
which would implant in them a love for the beauty
and dignity of their country&#8217;s traditions.</p>
<p>The modest author would never have claimed
for these little tales the interest which I think they
deserve. He wrote them for children, for he loved
children, and one can detect the presence of the
child listener at nearly every line. He was not
thinking of a literary audience; the child at his knee
was enough. This is why we hear (occasionally)
a certain <i>na&iuml;ve</i> accent which will not, perhaps, please
the contemporary critic; but (as there are many
who again find pleasure in early Victorian furniture)
it may please others; I confess it pleases me.
And the absence of literary self-consciousness is
itself pleasant; indeed, much of the charm of these
stories is the charm of their unpremeditated art.
But, though he did not write for the critics, Leamy
was in spite of himself a man of letters. He was
so genuinely an artist that he could not do the
thing ill. Any one of these stories will prove his
capacity: the first, for instance, about that princess
on the &#8220;bare, brown, lonely moor&#8221; who was &#8220;as
sweet and as fresh as an opening rosebud, and her
voice was as musical as the whisper of a stream in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xiv' name='page_xiv'></a>xiv</span>
the woods in the hot days of summer.&#8221; There is
not a flaw in it. It is so filled with simple beauty
and tenderness, and there is so much of the genuine
word-magic in its language, that one is carried away
as by the spell of natural oratory. It has, too, that
intimate sympathy with nature which is another
racial note in these stories. The enchanted moor,
with its silence, where no sound is heard&ndash;&ndash;the
wind which shouted beyond the mountains, &#8220;when
it sped across the moor it lost its voice, and passed
as silently as the dead&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;is affected by the fortune
of the tale equally with its human and its elfin
personages. When the knight arrives at last,
&#8220;wherever his horse&#8217;s hoofs struck the ground,
grass and flowers sprang up, and great trees with
leafy branches rose on every side.... As they
rode on beneath the leafy trees from every tree the
birds sang out, for the spell of silence over the lonely
moor was broken for ever.&#8221; This unpretentious
story, a child&#8217;s story, is as engaging as a gem.
And so, I think, are most of the others. One more
example to illustrate the quality of Leamy&#8217;s
style&ndash;&ndash;say, the description of the contest of the
bards before the High King at the Feis of Tara
in the story called &#8220;The Huntsman&#8217;s Son.&#8221;
The King gives the signal, the chief bard of Erin
ascends the mound in front of the royal enclosure,
and is greeted with a roar of cheers; but at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xv' name='page_xv'></a>xv</span>
the first note of his harp there is silence like that
of night.</p>
<p class="blockquote" >&#8220;As he moved his fingers softly over the strings every
heart was hushed, filled with a sense of balmy rest. The
lark, soaring and singing above his head, paused mute and
motionless in the still air, and no sound was heard over the
spacious plain save the dreamy music. Then the bard struck
another key, and a gentle sorrow possessed the hearts of his
hearers, and unbidden tears gathered to their eyes. Then,
with bolder hand, he swept his fingers across his lyre, and
all hearts were moved to joy and pleasant laughter, and
eyes that had been dimmed by tears sparkled as brightly
as running waters dancing in the sun. When the last notes
had died away a cheer arose, loud as the voice of the storm
in the glen when the live thunder is revelling on the mountain
tops.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the bard descends the mound the
Skald from the northern lands takes his place,
amid shouts of welcome.</p>
<p class="blockquote" >&#8220;He touched his harp, and in the perfect silence was heard
the strains of the mermaid&#8217;s song, and through it the pleasant
ripple of summer waters on the pebbly beach. Then the theme
was changed, and on the air was borne the measured sweep
of countless oars and the swish of waters around the prows
of contending galleys, and the breezy voices of the sailors
and the sea-bird&#8217;s cry. Then his theme was changed to the
mirth and laughter of the banquet hall, the clang of meeting
drinking-horns and songs of battle. When the last strain
ended, from the mighty host a great shout went up loud as the
roar of winter billows breaking in the hollows of the shore.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xvi' name='page_xvi'></a>xvi</span></p>
<p>Then comes the hero of the tale, Fergus, the
huntsman&#8217;s son.</p>
<p class="blockquote" >&#8220;He touched his harp with gentle fingers, and a sound,
low and soft as a faint summer breeze passing through forest
trees, stole out, and then was heard the rustle of birds through
the branches, and the dreamy murmur of waters lost in
deepest woods, and all the fairy echoes whispering when
the leaves are motionless in the noonday heat; then followed
notes, cool and soft as the drip of summer showers on the
parched grass, and then the song of the blackbird sounding
as clearly as it sounds in long silent spaces of the evening,
and then in one sweet jocund burst the multitudinous voices
that hail the breaking of the morn. And the lark, singing
and soaring above the minstrel, sank mute and motionless
upon his shoulder, and from all the leafy woods the birds
came thronging out and formed a fluttering canopy above
his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the bard ceased playing no shout arose from the
mighty multitude, for the strains of his harp, long after its
chords were stilled, held their hearts spell-bound.&#8221;</p>
<p>This passage reveals the poetry of the author&#8217;s
style, and it shows how charged it is with qualities
that are peculiar to the Celtic temperament: a style
in which expressions like &#8220;the song of the blackbird
sounding as clearly as it sounds in long silent
spaces of the evening,&#8221; or &#8220;she answered his salute
by a wave of her little hand, that was as white as
a wild rose in the hedges in June,&#8221; spring up
naturally, like daisies in the grass, at every turn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xvii' name='page_xvii'></a>xvii</span>
I have said enough, too, to indicate the type of
Celtic temperament to which Leamy&#8217;s belonged.
His habitual mood was the exquisitely sensitive,
the tender, playful, reverent mood. He was, in
this, the antithesis of the &#8220;cloudy and lightning&#8221;
Standish O&#8217;Grady, whose temperament, equally
Gaelic, is that of the fighting bard, delighting in
battle, fierce, fuliginous, aristocratic, pagan, with the
roll of Homeric hexameters in his martial style. If
O&#8217;Grady recalls the Oisin who contended with
Patrick and longed to be slaying with the Fianna,
even though they were in hell, Leamy, <i>anima
naturaliter Christiana</i>, reminds one rather of the
Irish monk in a distant land moved to write lyrics
in his missal by the song of the bird that makes
him think of Erin, or Marban, the hermit, rejoicing
to his brother, the king, in his &#8220;sheiling in the
wood,&#8221; his</p>

<p>It may not be amiss, in concluding this note,
to add a word about the author other than as he
appears in this book. These stories exhibit only
one aspect of his gifts. They happen to be one of
the things he wrote down. Most of the coinage
of his mind, and I think the best of it, came forth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xviii' name='page_xviii'></a>xviii</span>
in a form which does not permit of its being recalled,
the form of the spoken and unrecorded word.
He was by nature an improvisor. In the inclusive
sense of the term, the sense which includes
poetry, story-telling, description as well as pleading
and exhortation, he was a born orator; and he was
at his best when in the glow of pure improvisation.
It thus happened that it was often a group of friends
around a fireside, or a casual audience, who were the
witnesses of the most brilliant play of his genius.
He had a most observant and seeing eye.
A walk in the street was fraught with surprise, and
he would come back delighted with his adventures.
Every little common incident&ndash;&ndash;three little boys
with their backs to a wall looking up at a church
tower: he would catch snatches of their talk,
speculations about deep things and strange; he
would note that an old Irish apple-woman in a
grimy English town left her basket, with all her
stock-in-trade, outside in the street while she went
into a church to commune with her heavenly friends;
the conversation between a sapient publican,
a friendly constable and a group of dubious <i>bona
fide</i> travellers&ndash;&ndash;such things were materials for his
insight or his fancy or his delightful humour.
Often when he returned in the evening full of his
day&#8217;s observations one wished there had been a
shorthand-writer present to take down what fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_xix' name='page_xix'></a>xix</span>
from his lips. And just as it fell it would have
been literature. He was urged to write these things.
But Leamy had not readily the will or the power
to compel his spirit when the favoured moment
had passed. He was mostly passive, like an
&AElig;olian harp, under the visitation. Ill-health, too,
extreme and distressing, burdened him. He bore
his trials cheerfully, and strove manfully to write,
especially in his later days when the power and the
will seemed to come to him just as illness tightened
its hold. But he was sustained by the most
precious of blessings&ndash;&ndash;a wife with a brave and
bright soul, who appreciated him, and had a heart
as romantic as his own. Their love, indeed, was
an idyll, untouched by a shadow, through illness
and pain and hardship, to the hour of his death.</p>
<p>One ventures to wish that this little book may
make his kindly Irish spirit friends among a wider
circle, and especially amongst the children.</p>

<h2>PRINCESS FINOLA AND THE DWARF.</h2>
</div>
<p>A long, long time ago there lived in a little hut in
the midst of a bare, brown, lonely moor an old
woman and a young girl. The old woman was
withered, sour-tempered, and dumb. The young
girl was as sweet and as fresh as an opening rosebud,
and her voice was as musical as the whisper of a
stream in the woods in the hot days of summer.
The little hut, made of branches woven closely
together, was shaped like a beehive. In the centre
of the hut a fire burned night and day from year&#8217;s
end to year&#8217;s end, though it was never touched or
tended by human hand. In the cold days and nights
of winter it gave out light and heat that made the
hut cosy and warm, but in the summer nights and
days it gave out light only. With their heads to
the wall of the hut and their feet towards the fire
were two sleeping-couches&ndash;&ndash;one of plain woodwork,
in which slept the old woman; the other was
Finola&#8217;s. It was of bog-oak, polished as a looking-glass,
and on it were carved flowers and birds of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
all kinds, that gleamed and shone in the light of
the fire. This couch was fit for a princess, and a
princess Finola was, though she did not know it
herself.</p>
<p>Outside the hut the bare, brown, lonely moor
stretched for miles on every side, but towards the
east it was bounded by a range of mountains that
looked to Finola blue in the daytime, but which
put on a hundred changing colours as the sun went
down. Nowhere was a house to be seen, nor a
tree, nor a flower, nor sign of any living thing.
From morning till night, nor hum of bee, nor song
of bird, nor voice of man, nor any sound fell on
Finola&#8217;s ear. When the storm was in the air the
great waves thundered on the shore beyond the
mountains, and the wind shouted in the glens;
but when it sped across the moor it lost its voice,
and passed as silently as the dead. At first the
silence frightened Finola, but she got used to it
after a time, and often broke it by talking to herself
and singing.</p>
<p>The only other person beside the old woman
Finola ever saw was a dumb dwarf who, mounted
on a broken-down horse, came once a month to the
hut, bringing with him a sack of corn for the old
woman and Finola. Although he couldn&#8217;t speak
to her, Finola was always glad to see the dwarf
and his old horse, and she used to give them cake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
made with her own white hands. As for the dwarf
he would have died for the little princess, he was
so much in love with her, and often and often his
heart was heavy and sad as he thought of her
pining away in the lonely moor.</p>
<p>It chanced that he came one day, and she did
not, as usual, come out to greet him. He made
signs to the old woman, but she took up a stick
and struck him, and beat his horse and drove him
away; but as he was leaving he caught a glimpse
of Finola at the door of the hut, and saw that she
was crying. This sight made him so very miserable
that he could think of nothing else but her sad face
that he had always seen so bright, and he allowed
the old horse to go on without minding where he
was going. Suddenly he heard a voice saying:
&#8220;It is time for you to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dwarf looked, and right before him, at the
foot of a green hill, was a little man not half as big
as himself, dressed in a green jacket with brass
buttons, and a red cap and tassel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time for you to come,&#8221; he said the second
time; &#8220;but you are welcome, anyhow. Get off
your horse and come in with me, that I may touch
your lips with the wand of speech, that we may
have a talk together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dwarf got off his horse and followed the little
man through a hole in the side of a green hill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
The hole was so small that he had to go on his
hands and knees to pass through it, and when he
was able to stand he was only the same height as
the little fairyman. After walking three or four
steps they were in a splendid room, as bright as day.
Diamonds sparkled in the roof as stars sparkle in
the sky when the night is without a cloud. The
roof rested on golden pillars, and between the pillars
were silver lamps, but their light was dimmed by
that of the diamonds. In the middle of the room
was a table, on which were two golden plates and
two silver knives and forks, and a brass bell as big
as a hazelnut, and beside the table were two little
chairs covered with blue silk and satin.</p>

&#8220;The dwarf followed the little man through a hole in the side of a green hill&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;p. 3.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Take a chair,&#8221; said the fairy, &#8220;and I will ring
for the wand of speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dwarf sat down, and the fairyman rang the
little brass bell, and in came a little weeny dwarf
no bigger than your hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring me the wand of speech,&#8221; said the fairy,
and the weeny dwarf bowed three times and walked
out backwards, and in a minute he returned,
carrying a little black wand with a red berry at
the top of it, and, giving it to the fairy, he bowed
three times and walked out backwards as he had
done before.</p>
<p>The little man waved the rod three times over
the dwarf, and struck him once on the right shoulder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
and once on the left shoulder, and then touched
his lips with the red berry, and said: &#8220;Speak!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dwarf spoke, and he was so rejoiced at
hearing the sound of his own voice that he danced
about the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you at all, at all?&#8221; said he to the
fairy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is yourself?&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;But come,
before we have any talk let us have something to
eat, for I am sure you are hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they sat down to table, and the fairy rang
the little brass bell twice, and the weeny dwarf
brought in two boiled snails in their shells, and
when they had eaten the snails he brought in a
dormouse, and when they had eaten the dormouse
he brought in two wrens, and when they had eaten
the wrens he brought in two nuts full of wine, and
they became very merry, and the fairyman sang
&#8220;Cooleen dhas,&#8221; and the dwarf sang &#8220;The little
blackbird of the glen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear the &#8216;Foggy Dew?&#8217;&#8221; said
the fairy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll give it to you; but we must
have some more wine.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the wine was brought, and he sang the
&#8220;Foggy Dew,&#8221; and the dwarf said it was the
sweetest song he had ever heard, and that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
fairyman&#8217;s voice would coax the birds off the
bushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You asked me who I am?&#8221; said the fairy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I asked you who is yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; said the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who are you, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to tell the truth, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the
dwarf, and he blushed like a rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tell me what you know about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember nothing at all,&#8221; said the dwarf,
&#8220;before the day I found myself going along with
a crowd of all sorts of people to the great fair of
the Liffey. We had to pass by the king&#8217;s palace
on our way, and as we were passing the king sent
for a band of jugglers to come and show their
tricks before him. I followed the jugglers to look
on, and when the play was over the king called me
to him, and asked me who I was and where I came
from. I was dumb then, and couldn&#8217;t answer;
but even if I could speak I could not tell him what
he wanted to know, for I remember nothing of
myself before that day. Then the <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'King'">king</ins> asked
the jugglers, but they knew nothing about me,
and no one knew anything, and then the king
said he would take me into his service; and the
only work I have to do is to go once a month with
a bag of corn to the hut in the lonely moor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And there you fell in love with the little
princess,&#8221; said the fairy, winking at the dwarf.</p>
<p>The poor dwarf blushed twice as much as he had
done before.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not blush,&#8221; said the fairy; &#8220;it is a
good man&#8217;s case. And now tell me, truly, do you
love the princess, and what would you give to free
her from the spell of enchantment that is over her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would give my life,&#8221; said the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, listen to me,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;The
Princess Finola was banished to the lonely moor
by the king, your master. He killed her father,
who was the rightful king, and would have killed
Finola, only he was told by an old sorceress that
if he killed her he would die himself on the same
day, and she advised him to banish her to the
lonely moor, and she said she would fling a spell
of enchantment over it, and that until the spell
was broken Finola could not leave the moor. And
the sorceress also promised that she would send an
old woman to watch over the princess by night
and by day, so that no harm should come to her;
but she told the king that he himself should select
a messenger to take food to the hut, and that he
should look out for some one who had never seen
or heard of the princess, and whom he could trust
never to tell anyone anything about her; and that
is the reason he selected you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Since you know so much,&#8221; said the dwarf, &#8220;can
you tell me who I am, and where I came from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will know that time enough,&#8221; said the
fairy. &#8220;I have given you back your speech. It
will depend solely on yourself whether you will get
back your memory of who and what you were
before the day you entered the king&#8217;s service.
But are you really willing to try and break the
spell of enchantment and free the princess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever it will cost you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if it cost me my life,&#8221; said the dwarf;
&#8220;but tell me, how can the spell be broken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is easy enough to break the spell if you
have the weapons,&#8221; said the fairy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are they, and where are they?&#8221;
said the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spear of the shining haft and the dark blue
blade and the silver shield,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;They
are on the farther bank of the Mystic Lake in the
Island of the Western Seas. They are there for the
man who is bold enough to seek them. If you are
the man who will bring them back to the lonely
moor you will only have to strike the shield three
times with the haft, and three times with the
blade of the spear, and the silence of the moor
will be broken for ever, the spell of enchantment
will be removed, and the princess will be free.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will set out at once,&#8221; said the dwarf, jumping
from his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;And whatever it cost you,&#8221; said the fairy,
&#8220;will you pay the price?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, mount your horse, give him his
head, and he will take you to the shore opposite
the Island of the Mystic Lake. You must cross
to the island on his back, and make your way
through the water-steeds that swim around the
island night and day to guard it; but woe betide
you if you attempt to cross without paying the
price, for if you do the angry water-steeds will
rend you and your horse to pieces. And when you
come to the Mystic Lake you must wait until the
waters are as red as wine, and then swim your
horse across it, and on the farther side you will find
the spear and shield; but woe betide you if you
attempt to cross the lake before you pay the price,
for if you do, the black Cormorants of the Western
Seas will pick the flesh from your bones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the price?&#8221; said the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will know that time enough,&#8221; said the
fairy; &#8220;but now go, and good luck go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dwarf thanked the fairy, and said good-bye!
He then threw the reins on his horse&#8217;s neck, and
started up the hill, that seemed to grow bigger and
bigger as he ascended, and the dwarf soon found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
that what he took for a hill was a great mountain.
After travelling all the day, toiling up by steep
crags and heathery passes, he reached the top as
the sun was setting in the ocean, and he saw far
below him out in the waters the island of the
Mystic Lake.</p>
<p>He began his descent to the shore, but long
before he reached it the sun had set, and darkness,
unpierced by a single star, dropped upon the sea.
The old horse, worn out by his long and painful
journey, sank beneath him, and the dwarf was so
tired that he rolled off his back and fell asleep by
his side.</p>
<p>He awoke at the breaking of the morning, and
saw that he was almost at the water&#8217;s edge. He
looked out to sea, and saw the island, but nowhere
could he see the water-steeds, and he began to fear
he must have taken a wrong course in the night,
and that the island before him was not the one he
was in search of. But even while he was so thinking
he heard fierce and angry snortings, and, coming
swiftly from the island to the shore, he saw the
swimming and prancing steeds. Sometimes their
heads and manes only were visible, and sometimes,
rearing, they rose half out of the water, and, striking
it with their hoofs, churned it into foam, and tossed
the white spray to the skies. As they approached
nearer and nearer their snortings became more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
terrible, and their nostrils shot forth clouds of
vapour. The dwarf trembled at the sight and
sound, and his old horse, quivering in every limb,
moaned piteously, as if in pain. On came the
steeds, until they almost touched the shore, then
rearing, they seemed about to spring on to it.
The frightened dwarf turned his head to fly, and as
he did so he heard the twang of a golden harp,
and right before him who should he see but the
little man of the hills, holding a harp in one hand
and striking the strings with the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready to pay the price?&#8221; said he,
nodding gaily to the dwarf.</p>
<p>As he asked the question, the listening water-steeds
snorted more furiously than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready to pay the price?&#8221; said the
little man a second time.</p>
<p>A shower of spray, tossed on shore by the angry
steeds, drenched the dwarf to the skin, and sent a
cold shiver to his bones, and he was so terrified
that he could not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the third and last time, are you ready to
pay the price?&#8221; asked the fairy, as he flung the
harp behind him and turned to depart.</p>
<p>When the dwarf saw him going he thought of
the little princess in the lonely moor, and his
courage came back, and he answered bravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am ready.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>The water-steeds, hearing his answer, and snorting
with rage, struck the shore with their pounding
hoofs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to your waves!&#8221; cried the little harper;
and as he ran his fingers across his lyre, the
frightened steeds drew back into the waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the price?&#8221; asked the dwarf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your right eye,&#8221; said the fairy; and before
the dwarf could say a word, the fairy scooped out
the eye with his finger, and put it into his pocket.</p>
<p>The dwarf suffered most terrible agony; but he
resolved to bear it for the sake of the little princess.
Then the fairy sat down on a rock at the edge of
the sea, and, after striking a few notes, he began
to play the &#8220;Strains of Slumber.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound crept along the waters, and the steeds,
so ferocious a moment before, became perfectly
still. They had no longer any motion of their own,
and they floated on the top of the tide like foam
before a breeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the fairy, as he led the dwarf&#8217;s
horse to the edge of the tide.</p>
<p>The dwarf urged the horse into the water, and
once out of his depth, the old horse struck out
boldly for the island. The sleeping water-steeds
drifted helplessly against him, and in a short time
he reached the island safely, and he neighed joyously
as his hoofs touched solid ground.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>The dwarf rode on and on, until he came to a
bridle-path, and following this, it led him up
through winding lanes, bordered with golden furze
that filled the air with fragrance, and brought him
to the summit of the green hills that girdled and
looked down on the Mystic Lake. Here the horse
stopped of his own accord, and the dwarf&#8217;s heart
beat quickly as his eye rested on the lake, that,
clipped round by the ring of hills, seemed in the
breezeless and sunlit air&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;As still as death,<br />
And as bright as life can be.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>
<p>After gazing at it for a long time, he dismounted,
and lay at his ease in the pleasant grass. Hour
after hour passed, but no change came over the
face of the waters, and when the night fell sleep
closed the eyelids of the dwarf.</p>
<p>The song of the lark awoke him in the early
morning, and, starting up, he looked at the lake,
but its waters were as bright as they had been the
day before.</p>
<p>Towards midday he beheld what he thought was
a black cloud sailing across the sky from east to
west. It seemed to grow larger as it came nearer
and nearer, and when it was high above the lake
he saw it was a huge bird, the shadow of whose
outstretched wings darkened the waters of the lake;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
and the dwarf knew it was one of the Cormorants
of the Western Seas. As it descended slowly, he
saw that it held in one of its claws a branch of a
tree larger than a full-grown oak, and laden with
clusters of ripe red berries. It alighted at some
distance from the dwarf, and, after resting for a
time, it began to eat the berries and to throw the
stones into the lake, and wherever a stone fell a
bright red stain appeared in the water. As he
looked more closely at the bird the dwarf saw that
it had all the signs of old age, and he could not
help wondering how it was able to carry such a
heavy tree.</p>
<p>Later in the day, two other birds, as large as the
first, but younger, came up from the west and
settled down beside him. They also ate the
berries, and throwing the stones into the lake it
was soon as red as wine.</p>
<p>When they had eaten all the berries, the young
birds began to pick the decayed feathers off the old
bird and to smooth his plumage. As soon as they
had completed their task, he rose slowly from the
hill and sailed out over the lake, and dropping
down on the waters, dived beneath them. In a
moment he came to the surface, and shot up into
the air with a joyous cry, and flew off to the west
in all the vigour of renewed youth, followed by the
other birds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>When they had gone so far that they were like
specks in the sky, the dwarf mounted his horse and
descended towards the lake.</p>
<p>He was almost at the margin, and in another
minute would have plunged in, when he heard a
fierce screaming in the air, and before he had time
to look up, the three birds were hovering over the
lake.</p>
<p>The dwarf drew back frightened.</p>
<p>The birds wheeled over his head, and then,
swooping down, they flew close to the water,
covering it with their wings, and uttering harsh
cries.</p>
<p>Then, rising to a great height, they folded their
wings and dropped headlong, like three rocks, on
the lake, crashing its surface, and scattering a
wine-red shower upon the hills.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<p>Then the dwarf remembered what the fairy told
him, that if he attempted to swim the lake, without
paying the price, the three Cormorants of the
Western Seas would pick the flesh off his bones.
He knew not what to do, and was about to turn
away, when he heard once more the twang of the
golden harp, and the little fairy of the hills stood
before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faint heart never won fair lady,&#8221; said the
little harper. &#8220;Are you ready to pay the price?
The spear and shield are on the opposite bank,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
and the Princess Finola is crying this moment in
the lonely moor.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the mention of Finola&#8217;s name the dwarf&#8217;s
heart grew strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I am ready&ndash;&ndash;win or die.
What is the price?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your left eye,&#8221; said the fairy. And as soon
as said he scooped out the eye, and put it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>The poor blind dwarf almost fainted with
pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your last trial,&#8221; said the fairy, &#8220;and now
do what I tell you. Twist your horse&#8217;s mane round
your right hand, and I will lead him to the water.
Plunge in, and fear not. I gave you back your
speech. When you reach the opposite bank you
will get back your memory, and you will know who
and what you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the fairy led the horse to the margin of the
lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;In with you now, and good luck go with you,&#8221;
said the fairy.</p>
<p>The dwarf urged the horse. He plunged into
the lake, and went down and down until his feet
struck the bottom. Then he began to ascend, and
as he came near the surface of the water the dwarf
thought he saw a glimmering light, and when he
rose above the water he saw the bright sun shining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
and the green hills before him, and he shouted with
joy at finding his sight restored.</p>
<p>But he saw more. Instead of the old horse he
had ridden into the lake he was bestride a noble
steed, and as the steed swam to the bank the dwarf
felt a change coming over himself, and an unknown
vigour in his limbs.</p>
<p>When the steed touched the shore he galloped
up the hillside, and on the top of the hill was a
silver shield, bright as the sun, resting against a
spear standing upright in the ground.</p>
<p>The dwarf jumped off, and, running towards the
shield, he saw himself as in a looking-glass.</p>
<p>He was no longer a dwarf, but a gallant knight.
At that moment his memory came back to him,
and he knew he was Conal, one of the Knights of
the Red Branch, and he remembered now that the
spell of dumbness and deformity had been cast
upon him by the Witch of the Palace of the Quicken
Trees.</p>
<p>Slinging his shield upon his left arm, he plucked
the spear from the ground and leaped on to his
horse. With a light heart he swam back over the
lake, and nowhere could he see the black Cormorants
of the Western Seas, but three white swans
floating abreast followed him to the bank. When
he reached the bank he galloped down to the sea,
and crossed to the shore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>Then he flung the reins upon his horse&#8217;s neck,
and swifter than the wind the gallant horse swept
on and on, and it was not long until he was bounding
over the enchanted moor. Wherever his hoofs
struck the ground, grass and flowers sprang up,
and great trees with leafy branches rose on every
side.</p>
<p>At last the knight reached the little hut. Three
times he struck the shield with the haft and three
times with the blade of his spear. At the last
blow the hut disappeared, and standing before him
was the little princess.</p>
<p>The knight took her in his arms and kissed her;
then he lifted her on to the horse, and, leaping up
before her, he turned towards the north, to the palace
of the Red Branch Knights, and as they rode on
beneath the leafy trees from every tree the birds
sang out, for the spell of silence over the lonely
moor was broken for ever.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE IN THE LAKE.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>A long, long time ago there lived in a little hut,
in the midst of one of the inland lakes of Erin, an
old fisherman and his son. The hut was built on
stakes driven into the bed of the lake, and was so
high above the waters that even when they were
stirred into waves by the wind coming down from
the mountains they did not reach the threshold of
the door. Around, <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'ouside'">outside</ins> the hut, on a level with
the floor, was a little wicker-work platform, and
under the platform, close to the steps leading up
to it from the water, the fisherman&#8217;s curragh, made
of willows, covered with skins, was moored, and it
was only by means of the curragh that he and his
son, Enda, could leave their lake dwelling.</p>
<p>On many a summer evening Enda lay stretched
on the platform, watching the sunset fading from
the mountain-tops, and the twilight creeping over
the waters of the lake, and it chanced that once
when he was so engaged he heard a rustle in a
clump of sedge that grew close to one side of the
hut. He turned to where the sound came from,
and what should he see but an otter swimming
towards him, with a little trout in his mouth.
When the otter came up to where Enda was lying,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
he lifted his head and half his body from the water,
and flung the trout on the platform, almost at
Enda&#8217;s feet, and then disappeared.</p>
<p>Enda took the little panting trout in his hand;
but as he did so he heard, quite close to him, in the
lake, a sound like that of water plashing upon
water, and he saw the widening circles caused by
a trout which had just risen to a fly; and he said
to the little trout he held in his hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t keep you, poor thing! Perhaps that
was a little comrade come to look for you, and so
I&#8217;ll send you back to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>And saying this, he dropped the little trout into
the lake.</p>
<p>Well, when the next evening came, again Enda
was lying stretched outside the hut, and once more
he heard the rustle in the sedge, and once more
the otter came and flung the little trout almost
into his hands.</p>
<p>Enda, more surprised than ever, did not know
what to do. He saw that it was the same little
trout the otter had brought him the night before,
and he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I gave you a chance last night. I&#8217;ll give
you another, if only to see what will come of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he dropped the trout into the lake; but no
sooner had it touched the waters than it was
changed into a beautiful, milk-white swan. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Enda could hardly believe his eyes, as he saw it
sailing across the lake, until it was lost in the
sedges growing by the shore.</p>
<p>All that night he lay awake, thinking of what
he had seen, and as soon as the morning stood
on the hill-tops, and cast its shafts of golden
light across the lake, Enda rose and got into his
curragh.</p>
<p>He rowed all round the shores, beating the sedges
with his oar, in pursuit of the swan; but all in vain;
he could not catch a glimpse of her white plumage
anywhere. Day after day he rowed about the lake
in search of her, and every evening he lay outside
the hut watching the waters. At long last, one
night, when the full moon, rising above the mountains,
flooded the whole lake with light, he saw
the swan coming swiftly towards him, shining
brighter than the moonbeams. The swan came
on until it was almost within a boat&#8217;s length of the
hut; and what should Enda hear but the swan
speaking to him in his own language:</p>
<p>&#8220;Get into your curragh, Enda, and follow me,&#8221;
said she, and, saying this, she turned round and
sailed away.</p>
<p>Enda jumped into the curragh, and soon the
water, dripping from his oar, was flashing like
diamonds in the moonlight. And he rowed after
the swan, who glided on before him, until she came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
to where the shadows of the mountains lay deepest
on the lake. Then the swan rested, and when Enda
came up to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Enda,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I have brought you where
none may hear what I wish to say to you. I am
Mave, the daughter of the king of Erin. By the
magic arts of my cruel stepmother I was changed
into a trout, and cast into this lake a year and a
day before the evening when you restored me to
the waters the second time. If you had not done
so the first night the otter brought me to you I
should have been changed into a hooting owl; if
you had not done so the second night, I should
have been changed into a croaking raven. But,
thanks to you, Enda, I am now a snow-white swan,
and for one hour on the first night of every full
moon the power of speech is and will be given to
me as long as I remain a swan. And a swan I
must always remain, unless you are willing to break
the spell of enchantment that is over me; and you
alone can break it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything I can for you. O princess!&#8221;
said Enda. &#8220;But how can I break the spell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do so,&#8221; said the swan, &#8220;only by pouring
upon my plumage the perfumed water that fills
the golden bowl that is in the inmost room of the
palace of the fairy queen, beneath the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how can I get that?&#8221; said Enda.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the swan, &#8220;you must dive beneath
the lake, and walk along its bed, until you come to
where the lake dragon guards the entrance of the
fairy queen&#8217;s dominions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can dive like a fish,&#8221; said Enda; &#8220;but how
can I walk beneath the waters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do it easily enough,&#8221; said the swan,
&#8220;if you get the water-dress of Brian, one of the
three sons of Turenn, and his helmet of transparent
crystal, by the aid of which he was able to walk
under the green salt sea.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;And where shall I find them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are in the water-palace of Angus of the
Boyne,&#8221; said the swan; &#8220;but you should set out
at once, for if the spell be not broken before the
moon is full again, it cannot be broken for a year
and a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll set out in the first ray of the morning,&#8221;
said Enda.</p>
<p>&#8220;May luck and joy go with you,&#8221; said the swan.
&#8220;And now the hours of silence are coming upon
me, and I have only time to warn you that dangers
you little dream of will lie before you in your quest
for the golden cup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to face all dangers for your sake,
O princess,&#8221; said Enda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessings be upon you, Enda,&#8221; said the swan,
and she sailed away from the shadow out into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
light across the lake to the sedgy banks. And
Enda saw her no more.</p>
<p>He rowed his curragh home, and he lay on his
bed without taking off his clothes. And as the
first faint glimmer of the morning came slanting
down the mountains, he stepped into his curragh
and pulled across the lake, and took the road
towards the water-palace of Angus of the Boyne.</p>
<p>When he reached the banks of the glancing river
a little woman, dressed in red, was standing there
before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are welcome, Enda,&#8221; said she. &#8220;And
glad am I to see the day that brings you here to
help the winsome Princess Mave. And now wait
a second, and the water-dress and crystal helmet
will be ready for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, having said this, the little woman plucked
a handful of wild grasses, and she breathed upon
them three times and then flung them on the river,
and a dozen fairy nymphs came springing up
through the water, bearing the water-dress and
crystal helmet and a shining spear. And they laid
them down upon the bank at Enda&#8217;s feet, and then
disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Enda,&#8221; said the fairy woman, &#8220;take
these; by the aid of the dress and the helmet you
can walk beneath the waters. You will need the
spear to enable you to meet the dangers that lie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
before you. But with that spear, if you only have
courage, you can overcome everything and everyone
that may attempt to bar your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having said this, she bid good-bye to Enda, and
stepping off the bank, she floated out upon the
river as lightly as a red poppy leaf. And when she
came to the middle of the stream she disappeared
beneath the waters.</p>
<p>Enda took the helmet, dress, and spear, and it was
not long until he came to the sedgy banks where
his little boat was waiting for him. As he stepped
into the curragh the moon was rising above the
mountains. He rowed on until he came to the
hut, and having moored the boat to the door, he
put on the water-dress and the crystal helmet, and
taking the spear in his hand, he leaped over the
side of the curragh, and sank down and down until
he touched the bottom. Then he walked along
without minding where he was going, and the only
light he had was the shimmering moonlight, which
descended as faintly through the waters as if it
came through muffled glass. He had not gone very
far when he heard a horrible hissing, and straight
before him he saw what he thought were two
flaming coals. After a few more steps he found
himself face to face with the dragon of the lake,
the guardian of the palace of the fairy queen.
Before he had time to raise his spear, the dragon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
had wound its coils around him, and he heard its
horrible teeth crunching against the side of his
crystal helmet, and he felt the pressure of its coils
around his side, and the breath almost left his
body; but the dragon, unable to pierce the helmet,
unwound his coils, and soon Enda&#8217;s hands were
free, and before the dragon could attempt to seize
him again, he drove his spear through one of its
fiery eyes, and, writhing with pain, the hissing
dragon darted through a cave behind him. Enda,
gaining courage from the dragon&#8217;s flight, marched
on until he came to a door of dull brass set in the
rocks. He tried to push it in before him, but he
might as well have tried to push away the rocks.
While he was wondering what he should do, he
heard again the fierce hissing of the dragon, and
saw the red glare of his fiery eye dimly in the water.</p>
<p>Lifting his spear and hastily turning round to
meet the furious monster, Enda accidently touched
the door with the point of the spear, and the door
flew open. Enda passed through, and the door
closed behind him with a grating sound, and he
marched along through a rocky pass which led to
a sandy plain.</p>
<p>As he stepped from the pass into the plain the
sands began to move, as if they were alive. In a
second a thousand hideous serpents, almost the
colour of the sand, rose hissing up, and with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
forked tongues made a horrible, poisonous hedge
in front of him. For a second he stood dismayed,
but then, levelling his spear, he rushed against the
hedge of serpents, and they, shooting poison at
him, sank beneath the sand. But the poison did
not harm him, because of his water-dress and
crystal helmet.</p>
<p>When he had passed over the sandy plain, he
had to climb a great steep, jagged rock. When he
got to the top of the rock he saw spread out before
him a stony waste without a tuft or blade of grass.
At some distance in front of him he noticed a large
dark object, which he took to be a rock, but on
looking at it more closely he saw that it was a huge,
misshapen, swollen mass, apparently alive. And it
was growing bigger and bigger every moment.
Enda stood amazed at the sight, and before he
knew where he was the loathsome creature rose
from the ground, and sprang upon him before he
could use his spear, and, catching him in its horrid
grasp, flung him back over the rocks on to the
sandy plain. Enda was almost stunned, but the
hissing of the serpents rising from the sand around
him brought him to himself, and, jumping to his
feet, once more he drove them down beneath the
surface. He then approached the jagged rock,
on the top of which he saw the filthy monster
glaring at him with bloodshot eyes. Enda poised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
his spear and hurled it against his enemy. It
entered between the monster&#8217;s eyes, and from the
wound the blood flowed down like a black torrent
and dyed the plain, and the shrunken carcase
slipped down the front of the rocks and disappeared
beneath the sand. Enda once more ascended the
rock, and without meeting or seeing anything he
passed over the stony waste, and at last he came
to a leafy wood. He had not gone far in the wood
until he heard the sound of fairy music, and walking
on he came upon a mossy glade, and there he found
the fairies dancing around their queen. They were
so small, and were all so brightly dressed, that they
looked like a mass of waving flowers; but when he
was seen by them they vanished like a glorious
dream, and no one remained before him but the
fairy queen. The queen blushed at finding herself
alone, but on stamping her little foot three times
upon the ground, the frightened fairies all crept
back again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are welcome, Enda,&#8221; said the queen.
&#8220;My little subjects have been alarmed by your
strange dress and crystal helmet. I pray you take
them off; you do not need them here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enda did as he was bidden, and he laid down
his water-dress and helmet on the grass, and the
little fairies, seeing him in his proper shape, got
over their fright, and, unrestrained by the presence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
of the queen, they ran tumbling over one another
to try and get a good look at the crystal helmet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you have come for, Enda,&#8221; said
the queen. &#8220;The golden cup you shall have to-morrow;
but to-night you must share our feast,
so follow me to the palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having said this, the queen beckoned her pages
to her, and, attended by them and followed by
Enda, she went on through the wood. When they
had left it behind them Enda saw on a green hill
before him the snow-white palace of the fairy
queen.</p>
<p>As the queen approached the steps that led up
to the open door, a band of tiny fairies, dressed in
rose-coloured silk, came out, carrying baskets of
flowers, which they flung down on the steps to make
a fragrant carpet for her. They were followed by a
band of harpers dressed in yellow silken robes,
who ranged themselves on each side of the steps
and played their sweetest music as the queen
ascended.</p>
<p>When the queen, followed by Enda, entered the
palace, they passed through a crystal hall that led
to a banquet-room. The room was lighted by a
single star, large as a battle-shield. It was fixed
against the wall above a diamond throne.</p>
<p>The queen seated herself upon the throne, and
the pages, advancing towards her, and bending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
low, as they approached the steps, handed her a
golden wand.</p>
<p>The queen waved the wand three times, and a
table laden with all kinds of delicacies appeared
upon the floor. Then she beckoned Enda to her,
and when he stood beside her the fairy table was
no higher than his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I must make you smaller, Enda,&#8221;
said the queen, &#8220;or you will never be able to seat
yourself at my fairy table.&#8221;</p>
<p>And having said this, she touched Enda with the
golden wand, and at once he became as small as
her tallest page. Then she struck the steps of her
throne, and all the nobles of her court, headed by
her bards, took their places at the festive board.</p>
<p>The feast went on right merrily, and when the
tiny jewelled drinking-cups were placed upon the
table, the queen ordered the harpers to play.</p>
<p>And the little harpers struck the chords, and as
Enda listened to the music it seemed to him as if
he was being slowly lifted from his seat, and when
the music ended the fairies vanished, the shining
star went out, and Enda was in perfect darkness.</p>
<p>The air blew keenly in his face, and he knew not
where he was. At last he saw a faint grey light,
and soon this light grew broader and brighter,
and as the shadows fled before it, he could hardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
believe his eyes when he found himself in his
curragh on the lake, and the moonlight streaming
down from the mountain-tops.</p>
<p>For a moment he thought he must have been
dreaming; but there in the boat before him were
the crystal helmet, and the water-dress, and the
gleaming spear, and the golden bowl of perfumed
water that was to remove the spell of enchantment
from the white swan of the lake, and sailing towards
him from the sedgy bank came the snow-white
swan; and when she touched the boat, Enda put
out his hands and lifted her in, and then over her
plumage he poured the perfumed water from the
golden bowl, and the Princess Mave in all her
maiden beauty stood before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your oar, Enda,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and row to
the southern bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enda seized his oar, and the curragh sped across
the waters swifter than a swallow in its flight.
When the boat touched the shore Enda jumped
out, and lifted the princess on to the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send your boat adrift, Enda,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but
first take out your shining spear; the water-dress
and the crystal helmet will take care of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enda took out the spear, and then pushed the
boat from the bank. It sped on towards the hut
in the middle of the lake; but before it had reached
halfway six nymphs sprang up from the water and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
seizing the helmet and dress, sank with them
beneath the tide, and the boat went on until it
pushed its prow against the steps of the little hut,
where it remained.</p>
<p>Then Enda and the princess turned towards the
south, and it was not long until they came to a
deep forest, that was folding up its shadows and
spreading out its mossy glades before the glancing
footsteps of the morning. They had not gone far
through the forest when they heard the music of
hounds and the cries of huntsmen, and crashing
towards them through the low branches they saw
a fierce wild boar. Enda, gently pushing the
princess behind him, levelled his spear, and when
the boar came close to him he drove it into his
throat. The brute fell dead at his feet, and the
dogs rushing up began to tear it to pieces. The
princess fainted at the sight, and while Enda was
endeavouring to restore her, the king of Erin,
followed by his huntsmen, appeared, and when the
king saw the princess he started in amazement, as
he recognised the features of his daughter Mave.</p>
<p>At that moment the princess came to herself,
and her father, lifting her tenderly in his arms,
kissed her again and again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have mourned you as dead, my darling,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and now you are restored to me more
lovely than ever. I would gladly have given up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
my throne for this. But say who is the champion
who has brought you hither, and who has slain
the wild boar we have hunted so many years in
vain?&#8221;</p>
<p>The princess blushed like a rose as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Enda, father; it is he has brought
me back to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the king embraced Enda and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Enda, for asking any questions
about you before you have shared the hospitality
of my court. My palace lies beyond the forest,
and we shall reach it soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the king ordered his huntsman to sound
the bugle-horn, and all his nobles galloped up in
answer to it, and when they saw the Princess Mave
they were so dazzled by her beauty that they
scarcely gave a thought to the death of the wild
boar.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my daughter, Mave, come back to me,&#8221;
said the king.</p>
<p>And all the nobles lowered their lances, and
bowed in homage to the lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there stands the champion who has brought
her home,&#8221; said the king, pointing to Enda.</p>
<p>The nobles looked at Enda, and bowed courteously,
but in their hearts they were jealous of
the champion, for they saw he was already a
favourite of the king&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>Then the pages came up, leading milk-white
steeds with golden bridles, and the king, ordering
Enda to mount one of them, lifted Mave on to his
own, and mounted behind her. The pages, carrying
the boar&#8217;s head on a hollow shield, preceded
by the huntsmen sounding their horns, set out
towards the palace, and the royal party followed
them.</p>
<p>As the procession approached the palace crowds
came rushing out to see the trophies of the chase,
and through the snow-white door the queen, Mave&#8217;s
cruel stepmother, attended by her maids-of-honour
and the royal bards, came forth to greet the king.
But when she saw seated before him the Princess
Mave, who she thought was at the bottom of the
lake under a spell of enchantment, she uttered a
loud cry, and fell senseless to the ground.</p>
<p>The king jumped from his horse, and rushing to
the queen, lifted her up and carried her in his arms
to her apartments, for he had no suspicion of the
wickedness of which she had been guilty.</p>
<p>And the court leeches were summoned to attend
her, but she died that very night, and it was not
until a green mound, worthy of a queen of Erin,
had been raised over her grave that the Princess
Mave told her father of the wickedness of her stepmother.
And when she told him the whole story
of how Enda had broken the spell of enchantment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
and of the dangers which he had faced for her sake,
the king summoned an assembly of all his nobles,
and seated on his throne, wearing his golden
helmet, the bards upon his right hand and the Druids
upon his left, and the nobles in ranks before him
with gleaming helmets and flashing spears, he told
them the story of the princess, and of the service
which Enda had rendered to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;if the princess is
willing to take her deliverer for her husband, I am
willing that she shall be his bride; and if you, my
subjects, Bards and Druids and Nobles and Chiefs
of Erin, have anything to say against this union,
speak. But first, Mave,&#8221; said the king, as he drew
the blushing princess to him, &#8220;speak, darling, as
becomes the daughter of a king&ndash;&ndash;speak in the
presence of the nobles of Erin, and say if it is your
wish to become Enda&#8217;s bride.&#8221;</p>
<p>The princess flung her white arms around her
father&#8217;s neck, as she murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, it was Enda brought me back to you,
and before all the princes and nobles of Erin I am
willing to be his bride.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she buried her head upon the king&#8217;s breast,
and as he stroked her silken hair falling to her feet,
the bards struck their golden harps, but the sound
of the joyous music could hardly drown the murmurs
of the jealous nobles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>When the music ceased the king beckoned Enda
to him, and was about to place his hand in Mave&#8217;s
when a Druid, whose white beard almost touched
the ground, and who had been a favourite of the
dead stepmother, and hated Mave for her sake,
stepped forward and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;O King of Erin, never yet has the daughter of
a king been freely given in marriage to any save a
battle champion; and that stripling there has never
struck his spear against a warrior&#8217;s shield.&#8221;</p>
<p>A murmur of approbation rose from the jealous
princes, and Congal, the bravest of them all, stepped
out from the ranks, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Druid speaks the truth, O king! That
stripling has never faced a battle champion yet,
and, speaking for all the nobles of your land, I
challenge him to fight any one of us; and as he is
young and unused to arms, we are willing that the
youngest and least experienced amongst us should
be set against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Congal had spoken, the nobles, in approval
of his words, struck their shields with their swords,
and the brazen sound ascended to the skies.</p>
<p>The face of the princess, blushing a moment
before like a rose, became as white as a lily; but
the colour returned to her cheeks when she heard
Enda&#8217;s voice ringing loud and clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true, O king!&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
never used my spear in battle yet. The Prince
Congal has challenged me to meet the youngest
and least experienced of the chiefs of Erin. I have
risked my life already for your daughter&#8217;s sake.
I would face death a thousand times for the chance
of winning her for my bride; but I would scorn to
claim her hand if I dared not meet the boldest
battle champion of the nobles of Erin, and here
before you, O king, and bards, Druids, and nobles,
and chiefs of Erin, and here, in the presence of the
Lady Mave, I challenge the boldest of them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The king&#8217;s eyes flashed with joy as he listened to
the brave words of Enda.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; said the king; &#8220;the contest shall
take place to-morrow on the lawn outside our
palace gates; but before our assembly dissolves I
call on you, nobles and chiefs of Erin, to name
your boldest champion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loud cries of &#8220;Congal! Congal!&#8221; answered the
king&#8217;s speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you willing, Congal?&#8221; asked the king.</p>
<p>&#8220;Willing, O king!&#8221; answered Congal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;We shall all meet
again to-night in our banquet-hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the king, with the Princess Mave on his
arm, attended by his bards and Druids, entered the
palace, and the chiefs and nobles went their several
ways.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>At the feast that night the princess sat beside
the king, and Enda beside the princess, and the
bards and Druids, nobles and chiefs, took their
places in due order. And the bards sang songs of
love and battle, and never merrier hours were
spent than those which passed away that night in
the banquet-hall of Erin&#8217;s king.</p>
<p>When the feast was over Enda retired to his
apartment to spend the night dreaming of the
Princess Mave, and Congal went to his quarters;
but not to sleep or dream, for the Druid who had
provoked the contest came to him bringing his
golden wand, and all night long the Druid was
weaving spells to charm the shield and spear and
helmet of Congal, to make them invulnerable in the
battle of the morrow.</p>
<p>But while Enda lay dreaming of the Princess
Mave, the little fairy woman who gave him the
water-dress, and crystal helmet, and shining spear
on the banks of the Boyne, slid into his room, and
she placed beside his couch a silver helmet and a
silver shield. And she rubbed the helmet, and the
shield, and the blue blade and haft of his spear
with the juice of the red rowan berries, and she let
a drop fall upon his face and hands, and then she
slid out as silently as she came.</p>
<p>When the morning broke, Enda sprang from his
couch, and he could hardly believe his eyes when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
he saw the silver shield and helmet. At the sight
of them he longed for the hour of battle, and he
watched with eager gaze the sun climbing the sky;
and, after hours of suspense, he heard the trumpet&#8217;s
sound and the clangour of the hollow shields,
struck by the hard-pointed spears.</p>
<p>Putting on the helmet, and fastening the shield
upon his left arm, and taking the spear in his right
hand, he stepped out bravely to the fight. The
edge of the lawn before the palace gates was ringed
by the princes, nobles, and chiefs of Erin. And the
palace walls were thronged by all the beauties of
the Court and all the noble ladies of the land.
And on his throne, surrounded by his Druids, his
brehons, and his bards, was the king of Erin, and
at his feet sat the lovely Lady Mave.</p>
<p>As Enda stepped out upon the lawn, he saw
Congal advancing from the ranks of the nobles,
and the two champions approached each other until
they met right in front of the throne.</p>
<p>Then both turned towards the throne, and bowed
to the king and the Princess Mave; and then facing
each other again, they retired a space, and when
their spears were poised, ready for battle, the king
gave the signal, which was answered by the clang
of stricken shields, and Congal and Enda launched
their gleaming spears. They flashed like lightning
in the sunlit air, and in a second Congal&#8217;s had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
broken against Enda&#8217;s shield; but Enda&#8217;s, piercing
Congal&#8217;s helmet, hurled him senseless on the plain.</p>
<p>The nobles and chiefs could hardly realize that
in that single second their boldest champion was
overthrown; but when they saw him stretched
motionless on the grassy sward, from out their
ranks six warriors advanced to where the chieftain
lay, and sadly they bore him away upon their
battle-shields, and Enda remained victor upon the
field.</p>
<p>And then the king&#8217;s voice rang out clear as the
sound of a trumpet in the still morning:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bards and brehons, princes and nobles, and
chiefs of Erin, Enda has proved himself a battle
champion, and who amongst you now will dare
gainsay his right to claim my daughter for his
bride?&#8221;</p>
<p>And no answer came.</p>
<p>But when he summoned Enda to his throne, and
placed the lady&#8217;s hand in his, a cheer arose from
the great assembly, that proved that jealousy was
extinguished in all hearts, and that all believed
that Enda was worthy of the winsome bride; and
never since that day, although a thousand years
have passed, was there in all the world a brighter
and gayer wedding than the wedding of Enda and
the Princess Mave.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE WHITE CAT</h2>
</div>
<p>A long, long time ago, in a valley far away, the
giant Trencoss lived in a great castle, surrounded
by trees that were always green. The castle had a
hundred doors, and every door was guarded by a
huge, shaggy hound, with tongue of fire and claws
of iron, who tore to pieces anyone who went to the
castle without the giant&#8217;s leave. Trencoss had
made war on the King of the Torrents, and, having
killed the king, and slain his people, and burned
his palace, he carried off his only daughter, the
Princess Eileen, to the castle in the valley. Here
he provided her with beautiful rooms, and appointed
a hundred dwarfs, dressed in blue and yellow satin,
to wait upon her, and harpers to play sweet music
for her, and he gave her diamonds without number,
brighter than the sun; but he would not allow her
to go outside the castle, and told her if she went
one step beyond its doors, the hounds, with tongues
of fire and claws of iron, would tear her to pieces.
A week after her arrival, war broke out between
the giant and the king of the islands, and before
he set out for battle, the giant sent for the princess,
and informed her that on his return he would make
her his wife. When the princess heard this she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
began to cry, for she would rather die than marry
the giant who had slain her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crying will only spoil your bright eyes, my
little princess,&#8221; said Trencoss, &#8220;and you will have
to marry me whether you like it or no.&#8221;</p>
<p>He then bade her go back to her room, and he
ordered the dwarfs to give her everything she asked
for while he was away, and the harpers to play the
sweetest music for her. When the princess gained
her room she cried as if her heart would break.
The long day passed slowly, and the night came,
but brought no sleep to Eileen, and in the grey
light of the morning she rose and opened the window,
and looked about in every direction to see if there
were any chance of escape. But the window was
ever so high above the ground, and below were the
hungry and ever watchful hounds. With a heavy
heart she was about to close the window when she
thought she saw the branches of the tree that was
nearest to it moving. She looked again, and she
saw a little white cat creeping along one of the
branches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mew!&#8221; cried the cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little pussy,&#8221; said the princess. &#8220;Come
to me, pussy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back from the window,&#8221; said the cat,
&#8220;and I will.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center; width: 344px;'>
&#8220;&#8216;Poor little pussy,&#8217; said the Princess&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;p. 42.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The princess stepped back, and the little white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
cat jumped into the room. The princess took the
little cat on her lap and stroked him with her hand,
and the cat raised up its back and began to purr.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you come from, and what is your
name?&#8221; asked the princess.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter where I come from or what&#8217;s my
name,&#8221; said the <ins class="trchange" title="Changed '.' to ','">cat,</ins> &#8220;I am a friend of yours,
and I come to help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never wanted help worse,&#8221; said the princess.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said the cat; &#8220;and now listen
to me. When the giant comes back from battle
and asks you to marry him, say to him you will
marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I will never marry him,&#8221; said the princess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what I tell you,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;When he
asks you to marry him, say to him you will if his
dwarfs will wind for you three balls from the fairy
dew that lies on the bushes on a misty morning as
big as these,&#8221; said the cat, putting his right forefoot
into his ear and taking out three balls&ndash;&ndash;one yellow,
one red, and one blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are very small,&#8221; said the princess. &#8220;They
are not much bigger than peas, and the dwarfs
will not be long at their work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t they,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;It will take them
a month and a day to make one, so that it will take
three months and three days before the balls are
wound; but the giant, like you, will think they can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
be made in a few days, and so he will readily
promise to do what you ask. He will soon find
out his mistake, but he will keep his word, and will
not press you to marry him until the balls are
wound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When will the giant come back?&#8221; asked
Eileen.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will return to-morrow afternoon,&#8221; said the
cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you stay with me until then?&#8221; said the
princess. &#8220;I am very lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot stay,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;I have to go
away to my palace on the island on which no man
ever placed his foot, and where no man but one
shall ever come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is that island?&#8221; asked the princess,
&#8220;and who is the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The island is in the far-off seas where vessel
never sailed; the man you will see before many
days are over; and if all goes well, he will one day
slay the giant Trencoss, and free you from his
power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; sighed the princess, &#8220;that can never
be, for no weapon can wound the hundred hounds
that guard the castle, and no sword can kill the
giant Trencoss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a sword that will kill him,&#8221; said the
cat; &#8220;but I must go now. Remember what you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
are to say to the giant when he comes home, and
every morning watch the tree on which you saw
me, and if you see in the branches anyone you like
better than yourself,&#8221; said the cat, winking at the
princess, &#8220;throw him these three balls and leave
the rest to me; but take care not to speak a single
word to him, for if you do all will be lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I ever see you again?&#8221; asked the princess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time will tell,&#8221; answered the cat, and, without
saying so much as good-bye, he jumped through
the window on to the tree, and in a second was out
of sight.</p>
<p>The morrow afternoon came, and the giant
Trencoss returned from battle. Eileen knew of his
coming by the furious barking of the hounds, and
her heart sank, for she knew that in a few moments
she would be summoned to his presence. Indeed,
he had hardly entered the castle when he sent for
her, and told her to get ready for the wedding.
The princess tried to look cheerful, as she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be ready as soon as you wish; but you
must first promise me something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask anything you like, little princess,&#8221; said
Trencoss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Eileen, &#8220;before I marry you,
you must make your dwarfs wind three balls as
big as these from the fairy dew that lies on the
bushes on a misty morning in summer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; said Trencoss, laughing. &#8220;I
shall give the dwarfs orders at once, and by this
time to-morrow the balls will be wound, and our
wedding can take place in the evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you leave me to myself until then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Trencoss.</p>
<p>&#8220;On your honour as a giant?&#8221; said Eileen.</p>
<p>&#8220;On my honour as a giant,&#8221; replied Trencoss.</p>
<p>The princess returned to her rooms, and the
giant summoned all his dwarfs, and he ordered
them to go forth in the dawning of the morn and
to gather all the fairy dew lying on the bushes, and
to wind three balls&ndash;&ndash;one yellow, one red, and one
blue. The next morning, and the next, and the
next, the dwarfs went out into the fields and
searched all the hedgerows, but they could gather
only as much fairy dew as would make a thread as
long as a wee girl&#8217;s eyelash; and so they had to
go out morning after morning, and the giant fumed
and threatened, but all to no purpose. He was
very angry with the princess, and he was vexed
with himself that she was so much cleverer than
he was, and, moreover, he saw now that the
wedding could not take place as soon as he expected.</p>
<p>When the little white cat went away from the
castle he ran as fast as he could up hill and down
dale, and never stopped until he came to the Prince
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
of the Silver River. The prince was alone, and
very sad and sorrowful he was, for he was thinking
of the Princess Eileen, and wondering where she
could be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mew,&#8221; said the cat, as he sprang softly into the
room; but the prince did not heed him. &#8220;Mew,&#8221;
again said the cat; but again the prince did not
heed him. &#8220;Mew,&#8221; said the cat the third time, and
he jumped up on the prince&#8217;s knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you come from, and what do you
want?&#8221; asked the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;I come from where you would like to be,&#8221; said
the cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is that?&#8221; said the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, where is that, indeed! as if I didn&#8217;t know
what you are thinking of, and of whom you are
thinking,&#8221; said the cat; &#8220;and it would be far
better for you to try and save her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would give my life a thousand times over for
her,&#8221; said the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;For whom?&#8221; said the cat, with a wink. &#8220;I
named no name, your highness,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know very well who she is,&#8221; said the
prince, &#8220;if you knew what I was thinking of;
but do you know where she is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in danger,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;She is in
the castle of the giant Trencoss, in the valley
beyond the mountains.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will set out there at once,&#8221; said the prince
&#8220;and I will challenge the giant to battle, and will
slay him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easier said than done,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;There
is no sword made by the hands of man can kill
him, and even if you could kill him, his hundred
hounds, with tongues of fire and claws of iron,
would tear you to pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, what am I to do?&#8221; asked the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be said by me,&#8221; said the cat. &#8220;Go to the
wood that surrounds the giant&#8217;s castle, and climb
the high tree that&#8217;s nearest to the window that
looks towards the sunset, and shake the branches,
and you will see what you will see. Then hold
out your hat with the silver plumes, and three
balls&ndash;&ndash;one yellow, one red, and one blue&ndash;&ndash;will be
thrown into it. And then come back here as fast
as you can; but speak no word, for if you utter a
single word the hounds will hear you, and you shall
be torn to pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, the prince set off at once, and after two
days&#8217; journey he came to the wood around the
castle, and he climbed the tree that was nearest
to the window that looked towards the sunset, and
he shook the branches. As soon as he did so, the
window opened and he saw the Princess Eileen,
looking lovelier than ever. He was going to call
out her name, but she placed her fingers on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
lips, and he remembered what the cat had told
him, that he was to speak no word. In silence he
held out the hat with the silver plumes, and the
princess threw into it the three balls, one after
another, and, blowing him a kiss, she shut the
window. And well it was she did so, for at that
very moment she heard the voice of the giant, who
was coming back from hunting.</p>
<p>The prince waited until the giant had entered the
castle before he descended the tree. He set off as
fast as he could. He went up hill and down dale,
and never stopped until he arrived at his own
palace, and there waiting for him was the little
white cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you brought the three balls?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then follow me,&#8221; said the cat.</p>
<p>On they went until they left the palace far
behind and came to the edge of the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the cat, &#8220;unravel a thread of the
red ball, hold the thread in your right hand, drop
the ball into the water, and you shall see what
you shall see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prince did as he was told, and the ball
floated out to sea, unravelling as it went, and it
went on until it was out of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull now,&#8221; said the cat.</p>
<p>The prince pulled, and, as he did, he saw far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
away something on the sea shining like silver. It
came nearer and nearer, and he saw it was a little
silver boat. At last it touched the strand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the cat, &#8220;step into this boat and it
will bear you to the palace on the island on which
no man has ever placed his foot&ndash;&ndash;the island in the
unknown seas that were never sailed by vessels
made of human hands. In that palace there is a
sword with a diamond hilt, and by that sword
alone the giant Trencoss can be killed. There also
are a hundred cakes, and it is only on eating
these the hundred hounds can die. But mind what
I say to you: if you eat or drink until you reach
the palace of the little cat in the island in the
unknown seas, you will forget the Princess Eileen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will forget myself first,&#8221; said the prince, as
he stepped into the silver boat, which floated away
so quickly that it was soon out of sight of land.</p>
<p>The day passed and the night fell, and the stars
shone down upon the waters, but the boat never
stopped. On she went for two whole days and
nights, and on the third morning the prince saw
an island in the distance, and very glad he was;
for he thought it was his journey&#8217;s end, and he was
almost fainting with thirst and hunger. But the
day passed and the island was still before him.</p>
<p>At long last, on the following day, he saw by the
first light of the morning that he was quite close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
to it, and that trees laden with fruit of every kind
were bending down over the water. The boat
sailed round and round the island, going closer and
closer every round, until, at last, the drooping
branches almost touched it. The sight of the fruit
within his reach made the prince hungrier and
thirstier than he was before, and forgetting his
promise to the little cat&ndash;&ndash;not to eat anything until
he entered the palace in the unknown seas&ndash;&ndash;he
caught one of the branches, and, in a moment,
was in the tree eating the delicious fruit. While
he was doing so the boat floated out to sea and soon
was lost to sight; but the prince, having eaten,
forgot all about it, and, worse still, forgot all about
the princess in the giant&#8217;s castle. When he had
eaten enough he descended the tree, and, turning
his back on the sea, set out straight before him.
He had not gone far when he heard the sound of
music, and soon after he saw a number of maidens
playing on silver harps coming towards him. When
they saw him they ceased playing, and cried out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome! welcome! Prince of the Silver River,
welcome to the island of fruits and flowers. Our
king and queen saw you coming over the sea, and
they sent us to bring you to the palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prince went with them, and at the palace
gates the king and queen and their daughter
Kathleen received him, and gave him welcome.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
He hardly saw the king and queen, for his eyes
were fixed on the princess Kathleen, who looked
more beautiful than a flower. He thought he had
never seen anyone so lovely, for, of course, he had
forgotten all about poor Eileen pining away in her
castle prison in the lonely valley. When the king
and queen had given welcome to the prince a great
feast was spread, and all the lords and ladies of
the court sat down to it, and the prince sat between
the queen and the princess Kathleen, and long
before the feast was finished he was over head
and ears in love with her. When the feast was
ended the queen ordered the ballroom to be made
ready, and when night fell the dancing began, and
was kept up until the morning star, and the prince
danced all night with the princess, falling deeper
and deeper in love with her every minute. Between
dancing by night and feasting by day weeks went
by. All the time poor Eileen in the giant&#8217;s castle
was counting the hours, and all this time the dwarfs
were winding the balls, and a ball and a half were
already wound. At last the prince asked the king
and queen for their daughter in marriage, and they
were delighted to be able to say yes, and the day
was fixed for the wedding. But on the evening
before the day on which it was to take place the
prince was in his room, getting ready for a dance,
when he felt something rubbing against his leg,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
and, looking down, who should he see but the little
white cat. At the sight of him the prince remembered
everything, and sad and sorry he was
when he thought of Eileen watching and waiting
and counting the days until he returned to save
her. But he was very fond of the princess
Kathleen, and so he did not know what to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do anything to-night,&#8221; said the cat,
for he knew what the prince was thinking of, &#8220;but
when morning comes go down to the sea, and look
not to the right or the left, and let no living thing
touch you, for if you do you shall never leave the
island. Drop the second ball into the water, as
you did the first, and when the boat comes step
in at once. Then you may look behind you, and
you shall see what you shall see, and you&#8217;ll know
which you love best, the Princess Eileen or the
Princess Kathleen, and you can either go or <ins class="trchange" title="Added closing double-quote">stay.&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>The prince didn&#8217;t sleep a wink that night, and
at the first glimpse of the morning he stole from the
palace. When he reached the sea he threw out the
ball, and when it had floated out of sight, he saw
the little boat sparkling on the horizon like a
newly-risen star. The prince had scarcely passed
through the palace doors when he was missed, and
the king and queen and the princess, and all the
lords and ladies of the court, went in search of him,
taking the quickest way to the sea. While the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
maidens with the silver harps played sweetest
music, the princess, whose voice was sweeter than
any music, called on the prince by his name, and so
moved his heart that he was about to look behind,
when he remembered how the cat had told him
he should not do so until he was in the boat. Just
as it touched the shore the princess put out her
hand and almost caught the prince&#8217;s arm, but he
stepped into the boat in time to save himself, and
it sped away like a receding wave. A loud scream
caused the prince to look round suddenly, and
when he did he saw no sign of king or queen, or
princess, or lords or ladies, but only big green
serpents, with red eyes and tongues, that hissed
out fire and poison as they writhed in a hundred
horrible coils.</p>
<p>The prince, having escaped from the enchanted
island, sailed away for three days and three nights,
and every night he hoped the coming morning
would show him the island he was in search of.
He was faint with hunger and beginning to despair,
when on the fourth morning he saw in the distance
an island that, in the first rays of the sun, gleamed
like fire. On coming closer to it he saw that it
was clad with trees, so covered with bright red
berries that hardly a leaf was to be seen. Soon the
boat was almost within a stone&#8217;s cast of the island,
and it began to sail round and round until it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
well under the bending branches. The scent of the
berries was so sweet that it sharpened the prince&#8217;s
hunger, and he longed to pluck them; but, remembering
what had happened to him on the
enchanted island, he was afraid to touch them.
But the boat kept on sailing round and round, and
at last a great wind rose from the sea and shook
the branches, and the bright, sweet berries fell
into the boat until it was filled with them, and
they fell upon the prince&#8217;s hands, and he took up
some to look at them, and as he looked the desire
to eat them grew stronger, and he said to himself
it would be no harm to taste one; but when he
tasted it the flavour was so delicious he swallowed
it, and, of course, at once he forgot all about
Eileen, and the boat drifted away from him and
left him standing in the water.</p>
<p>He climbed on to the island, and having eaten
enough of the berries, he set out to see what might
be before him, and it was not long until he heard
a great noise, and a huge iron ball knocked down
one of the trees in front of him, and before he
knew where he was a hundred giants came running
after it. When they saw the prince they turned
towards him, and one of them caught him up in
his hand and held him up that all might see him.
The prince was nearly squeezed to death, and
seeing this the giant put him on the ground again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, my little man?&#8221; asked the giant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a prince,&#8221; replied the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are a prince, are you?&#8221; said the giant.
&#8220;And what are you good for?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>The prince did not know, for nobody had asked
him that question before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what he&#8217;s good for,&#8221; said an old giantess,
with one eye in her forehead and one in her chin.
&#8220;I know what he&#8217;s good for. He&#8217;s good to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the giants heard this they laughed so loud
that the prince was frightened almost to death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said one, &#8220;he wouldn&#8217;t make a mouthful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, leave him to me,&#8221; said the giantess, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ll fatten him up; and when he is cooked and
dressed he will be a nice dainty dish for the king.&#8221;</p>
<p>The giants, on this, gave the prince into the
hands of the old giantess. She took him home
with her to the kitchen, and fed him on sugar and
spice and all things nice, so that he should be a
sweet morsel for the king of the giants when he
returned to the island. The poor prince would
not eat anything at first, but the giantess held
him over the fire until his feet were scorched, and
then he said to himself it was better to eat than to
be burnt alive.</p>
<p>Well, day after day passed, and the prince grew
sadder and sadder, thinking that he would soon be
cooked and dressed for the king; but sad as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
prince was, he was not half as sad as the Princess
Eileen in the giant&#8217;s castle, watching and waiting
for the prince to return and save her.</p>
<p>And the dwarfs had wound two balls, and were
winding a third.</p>
<p>At last the prince heard from the old giantess
that the king of the giants was to return on the
following day, and she said to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;As this is the last night you have to live, tell
me if you wish for anything, for if you do your
wish will be granted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish for anything,&#8221; said the prince,
whose heart was dead within him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll come back again,&#8221; said the giantess,
and she went away.</p>
<p>The prince sat down in a corner, thinking and
thinking, until he heard close to his ear a sound
like &#8220;purr, purr!&#8221; He looked around, and there
before him was the little white cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought not to come to you,&#8221; said the cat;
&#8220;but, indeed, it is not for your sake I come. I
come for the sake of the Princess Eileen. Of course,
you forgot all about her, and, of course, she is
always thinking of you. It&#8217;s always the way&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Favoured lovers may forget,<br />
Slighted lovers never yet.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>The prince blushed with shame when he heard
the name of the princess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis you that ought to blush,&#8221; said the cat;
&#8220;but listen to me now, and remember, if you don&#8217;t
obey my directions this time you&#8217;ll never see me
again, and you&#8217;ll never set your eyes on the Princess
Eileen. When the old giantess comes back tell
her you wish, when the morning comes, to go down
to the sea to look at it for the last time. When you
reach the sea you will know what to do. But I
must go now, as I hear the giantess coming.&#8221;
And the cat jumped out of the window and disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the giantess, when she came in,
&#8220;is there anything you wish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true I must die to-morrow?&#8221; asked the
prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I should like to go down to
the sea to look at it for the last time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may do that,&#8221; said the giantess, &#8220;if you
get up early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be up with the lark in the light of the
morning,&#8221; said the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the giantess, and, saying
&#8220;good night,&#8221; she went away.</p>
<p>The prince thought the night would never pass,
but at last it faded away before the grey light of
the dawn, and he sped down to the sea. He threw
out the third ball, and before long he saw the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
boat coming towards him swifter than the wind.
He threw himself into it the moment it touched
the shore. Swifter than the wind it bore him out
to sea, and before he had time to look behind him
the island of the giantess was like a faint red speck
in the distance. The day passed and the night fell,
and the stars looked down, and the boat sailed on,
and just as the sun rose above the sea it pushed
its silver prow on the golden strand of an island
greener than the leaves in summer. The prince
jumped out, and went on and on until he entered
a pleasant valley, at the head of which he saw a
palace white as snow.</p>
<p>As he approached the central door it opened for
him. On entering the hall he passed into several
rooms without meeting with anyone; but, when he
reached the principal apartment, he found himself
in a circular room, in which were a thousand
pillars, and every pillar was of marble, and on
every pillar save one, which stood in the centre of
the room, was a little white cat with black eyes.
Ranged round the wall, from one door-jamb to the
other, were three rows of precious jewels. The
first was a row of brooches of gold and silver, with
their pins fixed in the wall and their heads outwards;
the second a row of torques of gold and
silver; and the third a row of great swords, with
hilts of gold and silver. And on many tables was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
food of all kinds, and drinking horns filled with
foaming ale.<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
<p>While the prince was looking about him the cats
kept on jumping from pillar to pillar; but seeing
that none of them jumped on to the pillar in the
centre of the room, he began to wonder why this
was so, when, all of a sudden, and before he could
guess how it came about, there right before him on
the centre pillar was the little white cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but you don&#8217;t know who I am. This is
the palace of the Little White Cat, and I am the
King of the Cats. But you must be hungry, and
the feast is spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, when the feast was ended, the king of the
cats called for the sword that would kill the giant
Trencoss, and the hundred cakes for the hundred
watch-dogs.</p>
<p>The cats brought the sword and the cakes and
laid them before the king.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;take these; you have no
time to lose. To-morrow the dwarfs will wind the last
ball, and to-morrow the giant will claim the princess
for his bride. So you should go at once; but before
you go take this from me to your little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the king gave him a brooch lovelier than any
on the palace walls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>The king and the prince, followed by the cats,
went down to the strand, and when the prince
stepped into the boat all the cats &#8220;mewed&#8221; three
times for good luck, and the prince waved his hat
three times, and the little boat sped over the waters
all through the night as brightly and as swiftly as
a shooting star. In the first flush of the morning
it touched the strand. The prince jumped out and
went on and on, up hill and down dale, until he
came to the giant&#8217;s castle. When the hounds saw
him they barked furiously, and bounded towards
him to tear him to pieces. The prince flung the
cakes to them, and as each hound swallowed his
cake he fell dead. The prince then struck his
shield three times with the sword which he had
brought from the palace of the little white cat.</p>
<p>When the giant heard the sound he cried out:
&#8220;Who comes to challenge me on my wedding-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dwarfs went out to see, and, returning,
told him it was a prince who challenged him to
battle.</p>
<p>The giant, foaming with rage, seized his heaviest
iron club, and rushed out to the fight. The fight
lasted the whole day, and when the sun went down
the giant said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had enough of fighting for the day.
We can begin at sunrise to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;Now or never;
win or die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take this,&#8221; cried the giant, as he aimed
a blow with all his force at the prince&#8217;s head; but
the prince, darting forward like a flash of lightning,
drove his sword into the giant&#8217;s heart, and, with
a groan, he fell over the bodies of the poisoned
hounds.</p>
<p>When the dwarfs saw the giant dead they began
to cry and tear their hair. But the prince told
them they had nothing to fear, and he bade them
go and tell the princess Eileen he wished to speak
with her. But the princess had watched the battle
from her window, and when she saw the giant fall
she rushed out to greet the prince, and that very
night he and she and all the dwarfs and harpers
set out for the Palace of the Silver River, which
they reached the next morning, and from that
day to this there never has been a gayer wedding
than the wedding of the Prince of the Silver River
and the Princess Eileen; and though she had
diamonds and pearls to spare, the only jewel she
wore on her wedding-day was the brooch which
the prince had brought her from the Palace of the
Little White Cat in the far-off seas.</p>

<a name='THE_GOLDEN_SPEARS' id='THE_GOLDEN_SPEARS'></a>
<h2>THE GOLDEN SPEARS.</h2>
</div>
<p>Once upon a time there lived in a little house
under a hill a little old woman and her two
children, whose names were Connla and Nora.
Right in front of the door of the little house lay
a pleasant meadow, and beyond the meadow rose
up to the skies a mountain whose top was sharp-pointed
like a spear. For more than half-way up
it was clad with heather, and when the heather
was in bloom it looked like a purple robe falling
from the shoulders of the mountain down to its
feet. Above the heather it was bare and grey,
but when the sun was sinking in the sea, its last
rays rested on the bare mountain top and made it
gleam like a spear of gold, and so the children
always called it the &#8220;Golden Spear.&#8221;</p>
<p>In summer days they gambolled in the meadow,
plucking the sweet wild grasses&ndash;&ndash;and often and
often they clambered up the mountain side, knee
deep in the heather, searching for frechans and
wild honey, and sometimes they found a bird&#8217;s
nest&ndash;&ndash;but they only peeped into it, they never
touched the eggs or allowed their breath to fall
upon them, for next to their little mother they
loved the mountain, and next to the mountain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
they loved the wild birds who made the spring and
summer weather musical with their songs.</p>
<p>Sometimes the soft white mist would steal
through the glen, and creeping up the mountain
would cover it with a veil so dense that the children
could not see it, and then they would say to each
other: &#8220;Our mountain is gone away from us.&#8221;
But when the mist would lift and float off into the
skies, the children would clap their hands, and say:
&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s our mountain back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the long nights of winter they babbled of the
spring and summertime to come, when the birds
would once more sing for them, and never a day
passed that they didn&#8217;t fling crumbs outside their
door, and on the borders of the wood that stretched
away towards the glen.</p>
<p>When the spring days came they awoke with
the first light of the morning, and they knew the
very minute when the lark would begin to sing,
and when the thrush and the blackbird would pour
out their liquid notes, and when the robin would
make the soft, green, tender leaves tremulous at
his song.</p>
<p>It chanced one day that when they were resting
in the noontide heat, under the perfumed shade
of a hawthorn in bloom, they saw on the edge of
the meadow, spread out before them, a speckled
thrush cowering in the grass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Connla! Connla! Look at the thrush&ndash;&ndash;and,
look, look up in the sky, there is a hawk!&#8221;
cried Nora.</p>
<p>Connla looked up, and he saw the hawk with
quivering wings, and he knew that in a second it
would pounce down on the frightened thrush. He
jumped to his feet, fixed a stone in his sling, and
before the whirr of the stone shooting through the
air was silent, the stricken hawk tumbled headlong
in the grass.</p>
<p>The thrush, shaking its wings, rose joyously in
the air, and perching upon an elm-tree in sight of
the children, he sang a song so sweet that they left
the hawthorn shade and walked along together
until they stood under the branches of the elm;
and they listened and listened to the thrush&#8217;s song,
and at last Nora said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Connla! did you ever hear a song so sweet
as this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Connla, &#8220;and I do believe sweeter
music was never heard before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the thrush, &#8220;that&#8217;s because you never
heard the nine little pipers playing. And now,
Connla and Nora, you saved my life to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Nora saved it,&#8221; said Connla, &#8220;for she
pointed you out to me, and also pointed out the
hawk which was about to pounce on you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was Connla saved you,&#8221; said Nora, &#8220;for he
slew the hawk with his sling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe my life to both of you,&#8221; said the thrush.
&#8220;You like my song, and you say you have never
heard anything so sweet; but wait till you hear
the nine little pipers playing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when shall we hear them?&#8221; said the
children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the thrush, &#8220;sit outside your door
to-morrow evening, and wait and watch until the
shadows have crept up the heather, and then, when
the mountain top is gleaming like a golden spear,
look at the line where the shadow on the heather
meets the sunshine, and you shall see what you
shall see.&#8221;</p>
<p>And having said this, the thrush sang another
song sweeter than the first, and then saying &#8220;good-bye,&#8221;
he flew away into the woods.</p>
<p>The children went home, and all night long they
were dreaming of the thrush and the nine little
pipers; and when the birds sang in the morning,
they got up and went out into the meadow to
watch the mountain.</p>
<p>The sun was shining in a cloudless sky, and no
shadows lay on the mountain, and all day long they
watched and waited, and at last, when the birds
were singing their farewell song to the evening
star, the children saw the shadows marching from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
the glen, trooping up the mountain side and
dimming the purple of the heather.</p>
<p>And when the mountain top gleamed like a
golden spear, they fixed their eyes on the line
between the shadow and the sunshine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Connla, &#8220;the time has come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, look! look!&#8221; said Nora, and as she spoke,
just above the line of shadow a door opened out,
and through its portals came a little piper dressed
in green and gold. He stepped down, followed by
another and another, until they were nine in all,
and then the door slung back again. Down
through the heather marched the pipers in single
file, and all the time they played a music so sweet
that the birds, who had gone to sleep in their nests,
came out upon the branches to listen to them
and then they crossed the meadow, and they
went on and on until they disappeared in the
leafy woods.</p>
<p>While they were passing the children were spell-bound,
and couldn&#8217;t speak, but when the music had
died away in the woods, they said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The thrush is right, that is the sweetest music
that was ever heard in all the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when the children went to bed that night the
fairy music came to them in their dreams. But
when the morning broke, and they looked out upon
their mountain and could see no trace of the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
above the heather, they asked each other whether
they had really seen the little pipers, or only
dreamt of them.</p>
<p>That day they went out into the woods, and they
sat beside a stream that pattered along beneath the
trees, and through the leaves tossing in the breeze
the sun flashed down upon the streamlet, and
shadow and sunshine danced upon it. As the
children watched the water sparkling where the
sunlight fell, Nora said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Connla, did you ever see anything so
bright and clear and glancing as that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Connla, &#8220;I never did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you never saw the crystal hall
of the fairy of the mountains,&#8221; said a voice above
the heads of the children.</p>
<p>And when they looked up, who should they see
perched on a branch but the thrush.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is the crystal hall of the fairy?&#8221;
said Connla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is where it always was, and where it
always will be,&#8221; said the thrush. &#8220;And you can
see it if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We would like to see it,&#8221; said the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said the thrush, &#8220;if you would,
all you have to do is to follow the nine little pipers
when they come down through the heather, and
cross the meadow to-morrow evening.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>And the thrush having said this, flew away.</p>
<p>Connla and Nora went home, and that night they
fell asleep talking of the thrush and the fairy and
the crystal hall.</p>
<p>All the next day they counted the minutes, until
they saw the shadows thronging from the glen and
scaling the mountain side. And, at last, they saw
the door springing open, and the nine little pipers
marching down.</p>
<p>They waited until the pipers had crossed the
meadow and were about to enter the wood. And
then they followed them, the pipers marching on
before them and playing all the time. It was not
long until they had passed through the wood, and
then, what should the children see rising up before
them but another mountain, smaller than their
own, but, like their own, clad more than half-way
up with purple heather, and whose top was bare
and sharp-pointed, and gleaming like a golden spear.</p>
<p>Up through the heather climbed the pipers, up
through the heather the children clambered after
them, and the moment the pipers passed the
heather a door opened and they marched in, the
children following, and the door closed behind
them.</p>
<p>Connla and Nora were so dazzled by the light
that hit their eyes, when they had crossed the
threshold, that they had to shade them with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
hands; but, after a moment or two, they became
able to bear the splendour, and when they looked
around they saw that they were in a noble hall,
whose crystal roof was supported by two rows of
crystal pillars rising from a crystal floor; and the
walls were of crystal, and along the walls were
crystal couches, with coverings and cushions of
sapphire silk with silver tassels.</p>
<p>Over the crystal floor the little pipers marched;
over the crystal floor the children followed, and
when a door at the end of the hall was opened to
let the pipers pass, a crowd of colours came rushing
in, and floor, and ceiling, and stately pillars, and
glancing couches, and shining walls, were stained
with a thousand dazzling hues.</p>
<p>Out through the door the pipers marched; out
through the door the children followed, and when
they crossed the threshold they were treading on
clouds of amber, of purple, and of gold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Connla,&#8221; said Nora, &#8220;we have walked into
the sunset!&#8221;</p>
<p>And around and about them everywhere were
soft, fleecy clouds, and over their heads was the
glowing sky, and the stars were shining through it,
as a lady&#8217;s eyes shine through a veil of gossamer.
And the sky and stars seemed so near that Connla
thought he could almost touch them with his
hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>When they had gone some distance, the pipers
disappeared, and when Connla and Nora came up
to the spot where they had seen the last of them,
they found themselves at the head of a ladder, all
the steps of which were formed of purple and amber
clouds that descended to what appeared to be a
vast and shining plain, streaked with purple and
gold. In the spaces between the streaks of gold
and purple they saw soft, milk-white stars. And
the children thought that the great plain, so far
below them, also belonged to cloudland.</p>
<p>They could not see the little pipers, but up the
steps was borne by the cool, sweet air the fairy
music; and lured on by it step by step they travelled
down the fleecy stairway. When they were little
more than half way down there came mingled
with the music a sound almost as sweet&ndash;&ndash;the
sound of waters toying in the still air with pebbles
on a shelving beach, and with the sound came the
odorous brine of the ocean. And then the children
knew that what they thought was a plain in the
realms of cloudland was the sleeping sea unstirred
by wind or tide, dreaming of the purple clouds
and stars of the sunset sky above it.</p>
<p>When Connla and Nora reached the strand they
saw the nine little pipers marching out towards
the sea, and they wondered where they were going
to. And they could hardly believe their eyes when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
they saw them stepping out upon the level ocean
as if they were walking upon the land; and away
the nine little pipers marched, treading the golden
line cast upon the waters by the setting sun. And
as the music became fainter and fainter as the
pipers passed into the glowing distance, the children
began to wonder what was to become of
themselves. Just at that very moment they saw
coming towards them from the sinking sun a little
white horse, with flowing mane and tail and golden
hoofs. On the horse&#8217;s back was a little man
dressed in shining green silk. When the horse
galloped on to the strand the little man doffed his
hat, and said to the children:</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to follow the nine little pipers?&#8221;
The children said, &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said the little man, &#8220;come up here
behind me; you, Nora, first, and Connla after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Connla helped up Nora, and then climbed on to
the little steed himself; and as soon as they were
properly seated the little man said &#8220;swish,&#8221; and
away went the steed, galloping over the sea without
wetting hair or hoof. But fast as he galloped the
nine little pipers were always ahead of him,
although they seemed to be going only at a walking
pace. When at last he came up rather close to
the hindmost of them the nine little pipers disappeared,
but the children heard the music playing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
beneath the <ins class="trchange" title="Changed ',' to '.'">waters.</ins> The white steed pulled up
suddenly, and wouldn&#8217;t move a step further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the little man to the children,
&#8220;clasp me tight, Nora, and do you, Connla, cling
on to Nora, and both of you shut your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children did as they were bidden, and the
little man cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Swish! swash!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the steed went down and down until at
last his feet struck the bottom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now open your eyes,&#8221; said the little man.</p>
<p>And when the children did so they saw beneath
the horse&#8217;s feet a golden strand, and above their
heads the sea like a transparent cloud between
them and the sky. And once more they heard the
fairy music, and marching on the strand before
them were the nine little pipers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must get off now,&#8221; said the little man, &#8220;I
can go no farther with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children scrambled down, and the little man
cried &#8220;swish,&#8221; and himself and the steed shot up
through the sea, and they saw him no more. Then
they set out after the nine little pipers, and it
wasn&#8217;t long until they saw rising up from the
golden strand and pushing their heads up into the
sea above, a mass of dark grey rocks. And as they
were gazing at them they saw the rocks opening,
and the nine little pipers disappearing through them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>The children hurried on, and when they came up
close to the rocks they saw sitting on a flat and
polished stone a mermaid combing her golden hair,
and singing a strange sweet song that brought the
tears to their eyes, and by the mermaid&#8217;s side was
a little sleek brown otter.</p>
<p>When the mermaid saw them she flung her golden
tresses back over her snow-white shoulders, and she
beckoned the children to her. Her large eyes were
full of sadness; but there was a look so tender
upon her face that the children moved towards her
without any fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to me, little one,&#8221; she said to Nora,
&#8220;come and kiss me,&#8221; and in a second her arms
were around the child. The mermaid kissed her
again and again, as the tears rushed to her eyes,
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nora, avourneen, your breath is as sweet as
the wild rose that blooms in the green fields of
Erin, and happy are you, my children, who have
come so lately from the pleasant land. Oh,
Connla! Connla! I get the scent of the dew of the
Irish grasses and of the purple heather from your
feet. And you both can soon return to Erin of
the Streams, but I shall not see it till three hundred
years have passed away, for I am Liban the Mermaid,
daughter of a line of kings. But I may not
keep you here. The Fairy Queen is waiting for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
you in her snow-white palace and her fragrant
bowers. And now kiss me once more, Nora, and
kiss me, Connla. May luck and joy go with you,
and all gentleness be upon you both.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a></p>
<p>Then the children said good-bye to the mermaid,
and the rocks opened for them and they passed
through, and soon they found themselves in a
meadow starred with flowers, and through the
meadow sped a sunlit stream. They followed the
stream until it led them into a garden of roses, and
beyond the garden, standing on a gentle hill, was
a palace white as snow. Before the palace was a
crowd of fairy maidens pelting each other with
rose-leaves. But when they saw the children they
gave over their play, and came trooping towards
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our queen is waiting for you,&#8221; they said; and
then they led the children to the palace door. The
children entered, and after passing through a long
corridor they found themselves in a crystal hall so
like the one they had seen in the mountain of the
golden spear that they thought it was the same.
But on all the crystal couches fairies, dressed in
silken robes of many colours, were sitting, and at
the end of the hall, on a crystal throne, was seated
the fairy queen, looking lovelier than the evening
star. The queen descended from her throne to
meet the children, and taking them by the hands,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
she led them up the shining steps. Then, sitting
down, she made them sit beside her, Connla on her
right hand and Nora on her left.</p>
<p>Then she ordered the nine little pipers to come
before her, and she said to them:</p>
<p>&#8220;So far you have done your duty faithfully,
and now play one more sweet air and your task is
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the little pipers played, and from the couches
at the first sound of the music all the fairies rose,
and forming partners, they danced over the crystal
floor as lightly as the young leaves dancing in the
wind.</p>
<p>Listening to the fairy music, and watching the
wavy motion of the dancing fairies, the children fell
asleep. When they awoke next morning and rose
from their silken beds they were no longer children.
Nora was a graceful and stately maiden, and Connla
a handsome and gallant youth. They looked at
each other for a moment in surprise, and then
Connla said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nora, how tall and beautiful you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not so tall and handsome as you are,
Connla,&#8221; said Nora, as she flung her white arms
round his neck and kissed her brother&#8217;s lips.</p>
<p>Then they drew back to get a better look of each
other, and who should step between them but the
fairy queen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nora, Nora,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I am not as high
as your knee, and as for you, Connla, you look as
straight and as tall as one of the round towers of
Erin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did we grow so tall in one night?&#8221;
said Connla.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one night!&#8221; said the fairy queen. &#8220;One
night, indeed! Why, you have been fast asleep,
the two of you, for the last seven years!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where was the little mother all that time?&#8221;
said Connla and Nora together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the little mother was all right. She knew
where you were; but she is expecting you to-day,
and so you must go off to see her, although I would
like to keep you&ndash;&ndash;if I had my way&ndash;&ndash;all to myself
here in the fairyland under the sea. And you will
see her to-day; but before you go here is a necklace
for you, Nora; it is formed out of the drops
of the ocean spray, sparkling in the sunshine.
They were caught by my fairy nymph, for you, as
they skimmed the sunlit billows under the shape
of sea-birds, and no queen or princess in the world
can match their lustre with the diamonds won
with toil from the caves of earth. As for you,
Connla, see here&#8217;s a helmet of shining gold fit for
a king of Erin&ndash;&ndash;and a king of Erin you will be yet;
and here&#8217;s a spear that will pierce any shield, and
here&#8217;s a shield that no spear can pierce and no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
sword can cleave as long as you fasten your warrior
cloak with this brooch of gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as she spoke she flung round Connla&#8217;s
shoulders a flowing mantle of yellow silk, and
pinned it at his neck with a red gold brooch.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, my children, you must go away from
me. You, Nora, will be a warrior&#8217;s bride in Erin
of the Streams. And you, Connla, will be king yet
over the loveliest province in all the land of Erin;
but you will have to fight for your crown, and days
of battle are before you. They will not come for a
long time after you have left the fairyland under
the sea, and until they come lay aside your helmet,
shield, and spear, and warrior&#8217;s cloak and golden
brooch. But when the time comes when you will
be called to battle, enter not upon it without the
golden brooch I give you fastened in your cloak,
for if you do harm will come to you. Now, kiss me,
children; your little mother is waiting for you at
the foot of the golden spear, but do not forget to
say good-bye to Liban the Mermaid, exiled from
the land she loves, and pining in sadness beneath
the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Connla and Nora kissed the fairy queen, and
Connla, wearing his golden helmet and silken
cloak, and carrying his shield and spear, led Nora
with him. They passed from the palace through
the garden of roses, through the flowery meadow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
through the dark grey rocks, until they reached the
golden strand; and there, sitting and singing the
strange, sweet song, was Liban the Mermaid.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you are going up to Erin,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;up through the covering waters. Kiss me,
children, once again; and when you are in Erin
of the Streams, sometimes think of the exile from
Erin beneath the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the children kissed the mermaid, and with
sad hearts, bidding her good-bye, they walked
along the golden strand. When they had gone
what seemed to them a long way, they began to
feel weary; and just then they saw coming towards
them a little man in a red jacket leading a coal-black
steed.</p>
<p>When they met the little man, he said: &#8220;Connla,
put Nora up on this steed; then jump up before
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Connla did as he was told, and when both of
them were mounted&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Connla,&#8221; said the little man, &#8220;catch the
bridle in your hands, and you, Nora, clasp Connla
round the waist, and close your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did as they were bidden, and then the little
man said, &#8220;Swash, swish!&#8221; and the steed shot up
from the strand like a lark from the grass, and
pierced the covering sea, and went bounding on
over the level waters; and when his hoofs struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
the hard ground, Connla and Nora opened their
eyes, and they saw that they were galloping towards
a shady wood.</p>
<p>On went the steed, and soon he was galloping
beneath the branches that almost touched Connla&#8217;s
head. And on they went until they had passed
through the wood, and then they saw rising up
before them the &#8220;Golden Spear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Connla,&#8221; said Nora, &#8220;we are at home at
last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Connla, &#8220;but where is the little
house under the hill?&#8221;</p>
<p>And no little house was there; but in its stead
was standing a lime-white mansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can this mean?&#8221; said Nora.</p>
<p>But before Connla could reply, the steed had
galloped up to the door of the mansion, and, in the
twinkling of an eye, Connla and Nora were standing
on the ground outside the door, and the steed had
vanished.</p>
<p>Before they could recover from their surprise the
little mother came rushing out to them, and flung
her arms around their necks, and kissed them both
again and again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, children! children! You are welcome home
to me; for though I knew it was all for the best,
my heart was lonely without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Connla and Nora caught up the little mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
in their arms, and they carried her into the hall
and set her down on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nora!&#8221; said the little mother, &#8220;you are a
head over me; and as for you, Connla, you look
almost as tall as one of the round towers of Erin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the fairy queen said, mother,&#8221;
said Nora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessings on the fairy queen,&#8221; said the little
mother. &#8220;Turn round, Connla, till I look at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Connla turned round, and the little mother said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Connla, with your golden helmet and your
spear, and your glancing shield, and your silken
cloak, you look like a king. But take them off, my
boy, beautiful as they are. Your little mother
would like to see you, her own brave boy, without
any fairy finery.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Connla laid aside his spear and shield, and
took off his golden helmet and his silken cloak.
Then he caught the little mother and kissed her,
and lifted her up until she was as high as his head.
And said he:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, little mother, I&#8217;d rather have
you than all the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that night, when they were sitting down by
the fire together, you may be sure that in the whole
world no people were half as happy as Nora,
Connla, and the little mother.</p>

<h2>THE FAIRY TREE OF DOOROS.<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Once upon a time the fairies of the west, going
home from a hurling-match with the fairies of the
lakes, rested in Dooros Wood for three days and
three nights. They spent the days feasting and
the nights dancing in the light of the moon, and
they danced so hard that they wore the shoes off
their feet, and for a whole week after the
leprechauns, the fairies&#8217; shoemakers, were working
night and day making new ones, and the rip, rap,
tap, tap of their little hammers were heard in all
the hedgerows.</p>
<p>The food on which the fairies feasted were little
red berries, and were so like those that grow on the
rowan tree that if you only looked at them you
might mistake one for the other; but the fairy
berries grow only in fairyland, and are sweeter than
any fruit that grows here in this world, and if an
old man, bent and grey, ate one of them, he became
young and active and strong again; and if an old
woman, withered and wrinkled, ate one of them,
she became young and bright and fair; and if a
little maiden who was not handsome ate of them,
she became lovelier than the flower of beauty.</p>
<p>The fairies guarded the berries as carefully as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
miser guards his gold, and whenever they were
about to leave fairyland they had to promise in the
presence of the king and queen that they would not
give a single berry to mortal man, nor allow one to
fall upon the earth; for if a single berry fell upon
the earth a slender tree of many branches, bearing
clusters of berries, would at once spring up, and
mortal men might eat of them.</p>
<p>But it chanced that this time they were in Dooros
Wood they kept up the feasting and dancing so
long, and were so full of joy because of their victory
over the lake fairies, that one little, weeny fairy,
not much bigger than my finger, lost his head, and
dropped a berry in the wood.</p>
<p>When the feast was ended the fairies went back
to fairyland, and were at home for more than a
week before they knew of the little fellow&#8217;s fault,
and this is how they came to know of it.</p>
<p>A great wedding was about to come off, and the
queen of the fairies sent six of her pages to Dooros
Wood to catch fifty butterflies with golden spots on
their purple wings, and fifty white without speck or
spot, and fifty golden, yellow as the cowslip, to
make a dress for herself, and a hundred white,
without speck or spot, to make dresses for the
bride and bridesmaids.</p>
<p>When the pages came near the wood they heard
the most wonderful music, and the sky above them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
became quite dark, as if a cloud had shut out the
sun. They looked up, and saw that the cloud was
formed of bees, who in a great swarm were flying
towards the wood and humming as they flew.
Seeing this they were sore afraid until they saw the
bees settling on a single tree, and on looking
closely at the tree they saw it was covered with
fairy berries.</p>
<p>The bees took no notice of the fairies, and so they
were no longer afraid, and they hunted the butterflies
until they had captured the full number of
various colours. Then they returned to fairyland,
and they told the queen about the bees and the
berries, and the queen told the king.</p>
<p>The king was very angry, and he sent his heralds
to the four corners of fairyland to summon all his
subjects to his presence that he might find out
without delay who was the culprit.</p>
<p>They all came except the little weeny fellow who
dropped the berry, and of course every one said
that it was fear that kept him away, and that he
must be guilty.</p>
<p>The heralds were at once sent in search of him,
and after a while they found him hiding in a cluster
of ferns, and brought him before the king.</p>
<p>The poor little fellow was so frightened that at
first he could scarcely speak a word, but after a
time he told how he never missed the berry until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
he had returned to fairyland, and that he was
afraid to say anything to anyone about it.</p>
<p>The king, who would hear of no excuse, sentenced
the little culprit to be banished into the land of
giants beyond the mountains, to stay there for ever
and a day unless he could find a giant willing to go
to Dooros Wood and guard the fairy tree. When
the king had pronounced sentence everyone was
very sorry, because the little fellow was a favourite
with them all. No fairy harper upon his harp, or
piper upon his pipe, or fiddler upon his fiddle, could
play half so sweetly as he could play upon an ivy
leaf; and when they remembered all the pleasant
moonlit nights on which they had danced to his
music, and thought that they should never hear or
dance to it any more, their little hearts were filled
with sorrow. The queen was as sad as any of her
subjects, but the king&#8217;s word should be obeyed.</p>
<p>When the time came for the little fellow to set out
into exile the queen sent her head page to him with a
handful of berries. These the queen said he was to
offer to the giants, and say at the same time that
the giant who was willing to guard the tree could
feast on berries just as sweet from morn till night.</p>
<p>As the little fellow went on his way nearly all the
fairies followed him to the borders of the land, and
when they saw him go up the mountain towards
the land of the giants, they all took off their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
little red caps and waved them until he was out
of sight.</p>
<p>On he went walking all day and night, and
when the sun rose on the morrow he was on the top
of the mountain, and he could see the land of the
giants in the valley stretched far below him.
Before beginning his descent he turned round for a
last glimpse of fairyland; but he could see nothing,
for a thick, dark cloud shut it out from view. He
was very sad, and tired, and footsore, and as he
struggled down the rough mountain side, he could
not help thinking of the soft, green woods and
mossy pathways of the pleasant land he had left
behind him.</p>
<p>When he awoke the ground was trembling, and a
noise that sounded like thunder fell on his ears.
He looked up and saw coming towards him a
terrible giant, with one eye that burned like a live
coal in the middle of his forehead, his mouth
stretched from ear to ear, his teeth were long and
crooked, the skin of his face was as black as night,
and his arms and chest were all covered with
black, shaggy hair; round his body was an iron
band, and hanging from this by a chain was a
great club with iron spikes. With one blow of this
club he could break a rock into splinters, and fire
could not burn him, and water could not drown
him, and weapons could not wound him, and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
was no way to kill him but by giving him three
blows of his own club. And he was so bad-tempered
that the other giants called him Sharvan
the Surly. When the giant spied the red cap of
the little fairy he gave the shout that sounded like
thunder. The poor fairy was shaking from head
to foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;What brought you here?&#8221; said the giant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Giant,&#8221; said the fairy, &#8220;the king of
the fairies banished me here, and here I must stay
for ever and a day, unless you come and guard the
fairy tree in Dooros Wood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless what?&#8221; roared the giant, and he gave
the fairy a touch of his foot that sent the little
fellow rolling down head over heels.</p>
<p>The poor fairy lay as if he were dead, and then
the giant, feeling sorry for what he had done, took
him up gently between his finger and thumb.</p>

&#8220;Sharvan took him up gently between his finger and thumb&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;p. 87.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened, little man,&#8221; said <ins class="trchange" title="Added comma">he,</ins> &#8220;and
now, tell me all about the tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the tree of the fairy berry that grows in
the Wood of Dooros,&#8221; said the fairy, &#8220;and I have
some of the berries with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you have, have you?&#8221; said the giant.
&#8220;Let me see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fairy took three berries from the pocket of
his little green coat, and gave them to the giant.</p>
<p>The giant looked at them for a second. He then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
swallowed the three together, and when he had
done so, he felt so happy that he began to shout
and dance for joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;More, you little thief!&#8221; said he. &#8220;More, you
little&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s your name?&#8221; said the giant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinkeen, please, Mr. Giant,&#8221; said the fairy, as
he gave up all the berries.</p>
<p>The giant shouted louder than before, and his
shouts were heard by all the other giants, who came
running towards him.</p>
<p>When Sharvan saw them coming, he caught up
Pinkeen, and put him in his pocket, that they
shouldn&#8217;t see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you shouting for?&#8221; said the giants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Sharvan, &#8220;that rock there fell
down on my big toe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not shout like a man that was hurt,&#8221;
said they.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it to you what way I shouted?&#8221;
said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might give a civil answer to a civil question,&#8221;
said they; &#8220;but sure you were always
Sharvan the Surly;&#8221; and they went away.</p>
<p>When the giants were out of sight, Sharvan took
Pinkeen out of his wallet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some more berries, you little thief&ndash;&ndash;I mean
little Pinkeen,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not any more,&#8221; said Pinkeen; &#8220;but if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
you will guard the tree in Dooros Wood you can
feast on them from morn till night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll guard every tree in the wood, if I may do
that,&#8221; said the giant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to guard only one,&#8221; said Pinkeen.</p>
<p>&#8220;How am I to get to it?&#8221; said Sharvan.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must first come with me towards fairyland,&#8221;
said the fairy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Sharvan; &#8220;let us go.&#8221; And
he took up the fairy and put him into his wallet, and
before very long they were on the top of the
mountain. Then the giant looked around towards
the giant&#8217;s land; but a black cloud shut it out from
view, while the sun was shining on the valley that
lay before him, and he could see away in the
distance the green woods and shining waters of
fairyland.</p>
<p>It was not long until he reached its borders, but
when he tried to cross them his feet stuck to the
ground and he could not move a step. Sharvan
gave three loud shouts that were heard all over
fairyland, and made the trees in the woods tremble,
as if the wind of a storm was sweeping over them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, Mr. Giant, let me out,&#8221; said Pinkeen.
Sharvan took out the little fellow, who, as soon as
he saw he was on the borders of fairyland ran as
fast as his legs could carry him, and before he had
gone very far he met all the little fairies who,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
hearing the shouts of the giant, came trooping out
from the ferns to see what was the matter. Pinkeen
told them it was the giant who was to guard the
tree, shouting because he was stuck fast on the
borders, and they need have no fear of him. The
fairies were so delighted to have Pinkeen back
again, that they took him up on their shoulders
and carried him to the king&#8217;s palace, and all the
harpers and pipers and fiddlers marched before
him playing the most jocund music that was ever
heard. The king and queen were on the lawn in
front of the palace when the gay procession came
up and halted before them. The queen&#8217;s eyes
glistened with pleasure when she saw the little
favourite, and the king was also glad at heart,
but he looked very grave as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why have you returned, sirrah?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Pinkeen told his majesty that he had
brought with him a giant who was willing to guard
the fairy tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is he and where is he?&#8221; asked the
king.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other giants called him Sharvan the Surly,&#8221;
said Pinkeen, &#8220;and he is stuck fast outside the
borders of fairyland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;you are pardoned.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the fairies heard this they tossed their little
red caps in the air, and cheered so loudly that a bee
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
who was clinging to a rose-bud fell senseless to
the ground.</p>
<p>Then the king ordered one of his pages to take a
handful of berries, and to go to Sharvan and show
him the way to Dooros Wood. The page, taking
the berries with him, went off to Sharvan, whose
roaring nearly frightened the poor little fellow to
death. But as soon as the giant tasted the berries
he got into good humour, and he asked the page
if he could remove the spell of enchantment from
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; said the page, &#8220;and I will if you
promise me that you will not try to cross the borders
of fairyland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise that, with all my heart,&#8221; said the
giant. &#8220;But hurry on, my little man, for there
are pins and needles in my legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The page plucked a cowslip, and picking out the
five little crimson spots in the cup of it, he flung one
to the north, and one to the south, and one to
the east, and one to the west, and one up into the
sky, and the spell was broken, and the giant&#8217;s
limbs were free. Then Sharvan and the fairy
page set off for Dooros Wood, and it was not long
until they came within view of the fairy tree.
When Sharvan saw the berries glistening in the
sun, he gave a shout so loud and strong that the
wind of it blew the little fairy back to fairyland.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
But he had to return to the wood to tell the giant
that he was to stay all day at the foot of the tree
ready to do battle with anyone who might come
to steal the berries, and that during the night he
was to sleep amongst the branches.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the giant, who could scarcely
speak, as his mouth was full of berries.</p>
<p>Well, the fame of the fairy-tree spread far and
wide, and every day some adventurer came to try
if he could carry away some of the berries; but
the giant, true to his word, was always on the
watch, and not a single day passed on which he
did not fight and slay a daring champion, and the
giant never received a wound, for fire could not
burn him, nor water drown him, nor weapon
wound him.</p>
<p>Now, at this time, when Sharvan was keeping
watch and ward over the tree, a cruel king was
reigning over the lands that looked towards the
rising sun. He had slain the rightful king by
foul means, and his subjects, loving their murdered
sovereign, hated the usurper; but much as they
hated him they feared him more, for he was brave
and masterful, and he was armed with a helmet
and shield which no weapon made by mortal
hands could pierce, and he carried always with
him two javelins that never missed their mark,
and were so fatal that they were called &#8220;the shafts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
of death.&#8221; The murdered king had two children&ndash;&ndash;a
boy, whose name was Niall, and a girl, who was
called Rosaleen&ndash;&ndash;that is, little Rose; but no rose
that ever bloomed was half as sweet or fresh or fair
as she. Cruel as the tyrant king was, he was
afraid of the people to kill the children. He sent
the boy adrift on the sea in an open boat, hoping
the waves would swallow it; and he got an old
witch to cast the spell of deformity over Rosaleen,
and under the spell her beauty faded, until at last
she became so ugly and wasted that scarcely
anyone would speak to her. And, shunned by
everyone, she spent her days in the out-houses
with the cattle, and every night she cried herself
to sleep.</p>
<p>One day, when she was very lonely, a little robin
came to pick the crumbs that had fallen about her
feet. He appeared so tame that she offered him the
bread from her hand, and when he took it she cried
with joy at finding that there was one living thing
that did not shun her. After this the robin came
every day, and he sang so sweetly for her that she
almost forgot her loneliness and misery. But once
while the robin was with her the tyrant king&#8217;s
daughter, who was very beautiful, passed with her
maids of honour, and, seeing Rosaleen, the princess
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there is that horrid ugly thing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>The maids laughed and giggled, and said they
had never seen such a fright.</p>
<p>Poor Rosaleen felt as if her heart would break, and
when the princess and her maids were out of sight
she almost cried her eyes out. When the robin saw
her crying he perched on her shoulder and rubbed
his little head against her neck and chirruped softly
in her ear, and Rosaleen was comforted, for she
felt she had at least one friend in the world, although
it was only a little robin. But the robin could do
more for her than she could dream of. He heard
the remark made by the princess, and he saw
Rosaleen&#8217;s tears, and he knew now why she was
shunned by everybody, and why she was so
unhappy. And that very evening he flew off to
Dooros Wood, and called on a cousin of his and
told him all about Rosaleen.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you want some of the fairy berries, I
suppose,&#8221; said his cousin, Robin of the Wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Rosaleen&#8217;s little friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Robin of the Wood, &#8220;times have
changed since you were here last. The tree is
guarded now all the day long by a surly giant. He
sleeps in the branches during the night, and he
breathes upon them and around them every
morning, and his breath is poison to bird and bee.
There is only one chance open, and if you try
that it may cost you your life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell me what it is, for I would give a
hundred lives for Rosaleen,&#8221; said her own little
robin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Robin of the Wood, &#8220;every day a
champion comes to battle with the giant, and the
giant, before he begins the fight, puts a branch of
berries in the iron belt that&#8217;s around his waist, so
that when he feels tired or thirsty he can refresh
himself, and there is just a bare chance, while he is
fighting, of picking one of the berries from the
branch; but if his breath fall on you it is certain
death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take the chance,&#8221; said Rosaleen&#8217;s robin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the other. And the two birds
flew through the wood until they came within sight
of the fairy tree. The giant was lying stretched at
the foot of it, eating the berries; but it was not long
until a warrior came, who challenged him to battle.
The giant jumped up, and plucking a branch from
the tree stuck it in his belt, and swinging his iron
club above his head strode towards the warrior, and
the fight began. The robin perched on a tree
behind the giant, and watched and waited for his
chance; but it was a long time coming, for the
berries were in front of the giant&#8217;s belt. At last
the giant, with one great blow, struck the warrior
down, but as he did so he stumbled and fell upon
him, and before he had time to recover himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
the little robin darted towards him like a flash and
picked off one of the berries, and then, as fast as
wings could carry him, he flew towards home, and
on his way he passed over a troop of warriors on
snow-white steeds. All the horsemen except one
wore silver helmets and shining mantles of green
silk, fastened by brooches of red gold, but the
chief, who rode at the head of the troop, wore a
golden helmet, and his mantle was of yellow silk,
and he looked by far the noblest of them all. When
the robin had left the horsemen far behind him he
spied Rosaleen sitting outside the palace gates
bemoaning her fate. The robin perched upon her
shoulder, and almost before she knew he was there
he put the berry between her lips, and the taste was
so delicious that Rosaleen ate it at once, and that
very moment the witch&#8217;s withering spell passed
away from her, and she became as lovely as the
flower of beauty. Just then the warriors on the
snow-white steeds came up, and the chief with
the mantle of yellow silk and the golden helmet
leaped from his horse, and bending his knee before
her, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairest of all fair maidens, you are surely the
daughter of the king of these realms, even though
you are without the palace gates, unattended, and
wear not royal robes. I am the Prince of the Sunny
Valleys.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter of a king I am,&#8221; said Rosaleen, &#8220;but
not of the king who rules these realms.&#8221;</p>
<p>And saying this she fled, leaving the prince
wondering who she could be. The prince then
ordered his trumpeters to give notice of his presence
outside the palace, and in a few moments the king
and all his nobles came out to greet the prince and
his warriors, and give them welcome. That night
a great feast was spread in the banquet-hall, and
the Prince of the Sunny Valleys sat by the king,
and beside the prince sat the king&#8217;s beautiful
daughter, and then in due order sat the nobles
of the court and the warriors who had come with
the prince, and on the wall behind each noble and
warrior his shield and helmet were suspended,
flashing radiance through the room. During the
feast the prince spoke most graciously to the lovely
lady at his side, but all the time he was thinking
of the unknown beauty he had met outside the
palace gates, and his heart longed for another
glimpse of her. When the feast was ended, and the
jewelled drinking-cups had gone merrily around
the table, the bards sang, to the accompaniment
of harps, the &#8220;Courtship of the Lady Eimer,&#8221; and
as they pictured her radiant beauty outshining
that of all her maidens, the prince thought that
fair as Lady Eimer was there was one still fairer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>When the feast was ended the king asked the
prince what brought him into his realms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I come,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;to look for a bride,
for it was foretold to me in my own country that
here only I should find the lady who is destined to
share my throne, and fame reported that in your
kingdom are to be found the loveliest maidens in
all the world, and I can well believe that,&#8221; added
the prince, &#8220;after what I have seen to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the king&#8217;s daughter heard this she hung
down her head and blushed like a rose, for, of
course, she thought the prince was alluding only to
herself, as she did not know that he had seen
Rosaleen, and she had not heard of the restoration
of her beauty.</p>
<p>Before another word could be spoken a great noise
and the clang of arms were heard outside the
palace. The king and his guests started from
their seats and drew their swords, and the bards
raised the song of battle; but their voices were
stilled and their harps silenced when they saw
at the threshold of the banquet hall a battle
champion, in whose face they recognised the features
of their murdered king.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Niall come back to claim his father&#8217;s
throne,&#8221; said the chief bard. &#8220;Long live Niall!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Long live Niall!&#8221; answered all the others.</p>
<p>The king, white with rage and amazement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
turned to the chiefs and nobles of his court, and
cried out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there none loyal enough to drive that
intruder from the banquet hall?&#8221;</p>
<p>But no one stirred, and no answer was given.
Then the king rushed forward alone, but before he
could reach the spot where Niall was standing
he was seized by a dozen chiefs and at once disarmed.</p>
<p>During this scene the king&#8217;s daughter had fled
frightened; but Rosaleen, attracted by the noise,
and hearing her brother&#8217;s name and the cheers
which greeted it, had entered the banquet hall
unperceived by anyone. But when her presence
was discovered every eye was dazzled with her
beauty. Niall looked at her for a second, wondering
if the radiant maiden before him could be the little
sister he had been separated from for so many
years. In another second she was clasped in his
arms.</p>
<p>Then the feast was spread again, and Niall told
the story of his adventures; and when the Prince
of the Sunny Valley asked for the hand of Rosaleen,
Niall told his lovely sister to speak for herself.
With downcast eyes and smiling lips she said,
&#8220;yes,&#8221; and that very day was the gayest and
brightest wedding that ever took place, and Rosaleen
became the prince&#8217;s bride.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>In her happiness she did not forget the little
robin, who was her friend in sorrow. She took him
home with her to Sunny Valleys, and every day
she fed him with her own hands, and every day
he sang for her the sweetest songs that were ever
heard in lady&#8217;s bower.</p>

<a name='THE_ENCHANTED_CAVE' id='THE_ENCHANTED_CAVE'></a>
<h2>THE ENCHANTED CAVE.</h2>
</div>
<p>A long, long time ago, Prince Cuglas,<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> master of the
hounds to the high King of Erin, set out from Tara
to the chase. As he was leaving the palace the
light mists were drifting away from the hill-tops,
and the rays of the morning sun were falling aslant
on the <i>grinan</i> or sunny bower of the Princess Ailinn.
Glancing towards it the prince doffed his plumed
and jewelled hunting-cap, and the princess answered
his salute by a wave of her little hand, that was as
white as a wild rose in the hedges in June, and
leaning from her bower, she watched the huntsman
until his tossing plumes were hidden by the green
waving branches of the woods.</p>
<p>The Princess Ailinn was over head and ears in
love with Cuglas, and Cuglas was over head and ears
in love with the Princess Ailinn, and he believed
that never was summer morning half as bright, or as
sweet, or as fair as she. The glimpse which he had
just caught of her filled his heart with delight, and
almost put all thought of hunting out of his head,
when suddenly the tuneful cries of the hounds,
answered by a hundred echoes from the groves,
broke upon his ear.</p>
<p>The dogs had started a dappled deer that bounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
away through the forest. The prince, spurring his
gallant steed, pushed on in eager pursuit.</p>
<p>On through the forest sped the deer, through soft,
green, secret ways and flowery dells, then out from
the forest, up heathery hills, and over long stretches
of moorland, and across brown rushing streams,
sometimes in view of the hounds, sometimes lost to
sight, but always ahead of them.</p>
<p>All day long the chase continued, and at last,
when the sun was sinking, the dogs were close upon
the panting deer, and the prince believed he was
about to secure his game, when the deer suddenly
disappeared through the mouth of a cave which
opened before him. The dogs followed at his heels,
and the prince endeavoured to rein in his steed, but
the impetuous animal bore him on, and soon was
clattering over the stony floor of the cave in perfect
darkness. <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Cuglass'">Cuglas</ins> could hear ahead of him the
cries of the hounds growing fainter and fainter, as
they increased the distance between them and him.
Then the cries ceased altogether, and the only
sound the prince heard was the noise of his horse&#8217;s
hoofs sounding in the hollow cave. Once more he
endeavoured to check his career, but the reins broke
in his hands, and in that instant the prince felt the
horse had taken a plunge into a gulf, and was
sinking down and down, as a stone cast from the
summit of a cliff sinks down to the sea. At last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
the horse struck the ground again, and the prince
was almost thrown out of his saddle, but he
succeeded in regaining his seat. Then on through
the darkness galloped the steed, and when he
came into the light the prince&#8217;s eyes were for some
time unable to bear it. But when he got used to
the brightness he saw he was galloping over a
grassy plain, and in the distance he perceived the
hounds rushing towards a wood faintly visible
through a luminous summer haze. The prince
galloped on, and as he approached the wood he saw
coming towards him a comely champion, wearing
a shining brown cloak, fastened by a bright bronze
spear-like brooch, and bearing a white hazel wand
in one hand, and a single-edged sword with a hilt
made from the tooth of a sea-horse in the other;<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>
and the prince knew by the dress of the champion,
and by his wand and sword, that he was a royal
herald. As the herald came close to him the
prince&#8217;s steed stopped of his own accord.</p>

</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome, Cuglas,&#8221; said the herald,
&#8220;and I have been sent by the Princess Crede to
greet you and to lead you to her court, where you
have been so long expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not how this may be,&#8221; said Cuglas.</p>
<p>&#8220;How it has come about I shall tell you as we go
along,&#8221; said the herald. &#8220;The Princess Crede is
the Queen of the Floating Island. And it chanced,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
once upon a day, when she was visiting her fairy
kinsmen, who dwell in one of the pleasant hills that
lie near Tara, she saw you with the high king and
princes and nobles of Erin following the chase.
And seeing you her heart went out to you, and
wishing to bring you to her court, she sent one of
her nymphs, in the form of a deer, to lure you on
through the cave, which is the entrance to this
land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply honoured by the preference shown
me by the princess,&#8221; said Cuglas, &#8220;but I may not
tarry in her court; for above in Erin there is the
Lady Ailinn, the loveliest of all the ladies who
grace the royal palace, and before the princess and
chiefs of Erin she has promised to be my bride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of that I know not,&#8221; said the herald; &#8220;but a
true champion, like you, cannot, I know, refuse to
come with me to the court of the Princess Crede.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the herald had said these words the prince
and he were on the verge of the wood, and they
entered upon a mossy pathway that broadened
out as they advanced until it was as wide as one
of the great roads of Erin. Before they had gone
very far the prince heard the tinkling of silver
bells in the distance, and almost as soon as he heard
them he saw coming up towards him a troop of
warriors on coal black steeds. All the warriors
wore helmets of shining silver, and cloaks of blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
silk. And on the horses&#8217; breasts were crescents
of silver, on which were hung tiny silver bells,
shaking out music with the motion of the horses.
As the prince approached the champions they
lowered their spears, and dividing in two lines the
prince and the herald passed between the ranks,
and the champions, forming again, followed on
behind the prince.</p>
<p>At last they passed through the wood, and they
found themselves on a green plain, speckled with
flowers, and they had not gone far when the prince
saw coming towards him a hundred champions on
snow-white steeds, and around the breasts of the
steeds were crescents of gold, from which were
hanging little golden bells.<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> The warriors all wore
golden helmets, and the shafts of their shining
spears were of gold, and golden sandals on their
feet, and yellow silken mantles fell down over their
shoulders. And when the prince came near them
they lowered their lances, and then they turned
their horses&#8217; heads around and marched before him.
And it was not long until above the pleasant jingle
of the bells the prince heard the measured strains
of music, and he saw coming towards him a band of
harpers, dressed in green and gold, and when the
harpers had saluted the prince they marched in
front of the cavalcade, playing all the time, and it
was not long until they came to a stream that ran
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
like a blue riband around the foot of a green hill,
on the top of which was a sparkling palace; the
stream was crossed by a golden bridge, so narrow
that the horsemen had to go two-by-two. The
herald asked the prince to halt and to allow all
the champions to go before him; and the cavalcade
ascended the hill, the sunlight brightly glancing on
helmet and on lance, and when it reached the
palace the horsemen filed around the walls.</p>
<p>When at length the prince and herald crossed the
bridge and began to climb the hill, the prince
thought he felt the ground moving under them,
and on looking back he could see no sign of the
golden bridge, and the blue stream had already
become as wide as a great river, and was becoming
wider every second.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are on the floating island now,&#8221; said the
herald, &#8220;and before you is the palace of the
Princess Crede.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment the queen came out through the
palace door, and the prince was so dazzled by her
beauty, that only for the golden bracelet he wore
upon his right arm, under the sleeve of his silken
tunic, he might almost have forgotten the Princess
Ailinn. This bracelet was made by the dwarfs who
dwell in the heart of the Scandinavian Mountains,
and was sent with other costly presents by the King
of Scandinavia to the King of Erin, and he gave it to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the princess, and it was the virtue of this bracelet,
that whoever was wearing it could not forget the
person who gave it to him, and it could never be
loosened from the arm by any art or magic spell;
but if the wearer, even for a single moment, liked
anyone better than the person who gave it to him,
that very moment the bracelet fell off from the arm
and could never again be fastened on. And when
the princess promised her hand in marriage to the
Prince Cuglas, she closed the bracelet on his arm.</p>
<p>The fairy queen knew nothing about the bracelet,
and she hoped that before the prince was long in
the floating island he would forget all about the
princess.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are welcome, <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Cuglass'">Cuglas</ins>,&#8221; said the queen, as
she held out her hand, and Cuglas, having thanked
her for her welcome, they entered the palace
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be weary after your long journey,&#8221;
said the queen. &#8220;My page will lead you to your
apartments, where a bath of the cool blue waters of
the lake has been made ready for you, and when
you have taken your bath the pages will lead you
to the banquet hall, where the feast is spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the feast the prince was seated beside the
queen, and she talked to him of all the pleasures
that were in store for him in fairyland, where pain,
and sickness, and sorrow, and old age, are unknown,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
and where every rosy hour that flies is brighter than
the one that has fled before it. And when the
feast was ended the queen opened the dance with
the prince, and it was not until the moon was high
above the floating island that the prince retired
to rest.</p>
<p>He was so tired after his journey and the dancing
that he fell into a sound sleep. When he awoke
the next morning the sun was shining brightly,
and he heard outside the palace the jingle of bells
and the music of baying hounds, and his heart was
stirred by memories of the many pleasant days on
which he had led the chase over the plains and
through the green woods of Tara.</p>
<p>He looked out through the window, and he saw
all the fairy champions mounted on their steeds
ready for the chase, and at their head the fairy
queen. And at that moment the pages came to
say the queen wished to know if he would join
them, and the prince went out and found his steed
ready saddled and bridled, and they spent the day
hunting in the forest that stretched away for miles
behind the palace, and the night in feasting and
dancing.</p>
<p>When the prince awoke the following morning he
was summoned by the pages to the presence of the
queen. The prince found the queen on the lawn
outside the palace surrounded by her court.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We shall go on the lake to-day, Cuglas,&#8221; said
the queen, and taking his arm she led him along
the water&#8217;s edge, all the courtiers following.</p>
<p>When she was close to the water she waved her
wand, and in a second a thousand boats, shining
like glass, shot up from beneath the lake and set
their bows against the bank. The queen and Cuglas
stepped into one, and when they were seated two
fairy harpers took their places in the prow. All the
other boats were soon thronged by fairies, and then
the queen waved her wand again, and an awning of
purple silk rose over the boat, and silken awning of
various colours over the others, and the royal boat
moved off from the bank followed by all the rest,
and in every boat sat a harper with a golden harp,
and when the queen waved her wand for the third
time, the harpers struck the trembling chords, and
to the sound of the delightful music the boats
glided over the sunlit lake. And on they went
until they approached the mouth of a gentle river
sliding down between banks clad with trees. Up
the river, close to the bank and under the drooping
trees, they sailed, and when they came to a bend
in the river, from which the lake could be no longer
seen, they pushed their prows in against the bank,
and the queen and Cuglas, and all the party, left
the boats and went on under the trees until they
came to a mossy glade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>Then the queen waved her wand, and silken
couches were spread under the trees, and she and
Cuglas sat on one apart from the others, and the
courtiers took their places in proper order.</p>
<p>And the queen waved her wand again, and wind
shook the trees above them, and the most luscious
fruit that was ever tasted fell down into their
hands; and when the feast was over there was
dancing in the glades to the music of the harps,
and when they were tired dancing they set out
for the boats, and the moon was rising above the
trees as they sailed away over the lake, and it was
not long until they reached the bank below the
fairy palace.</p>
<p>Well, between hunting in the forest, and sailing
over the lake, and dancing in the greenwood glade
and in the banquet hall, the days passed, but all
the time the prince was thinking of the Princess
Ailinn, and one moonlit night, when he was lying
awake on his couch thinking of her, a shadow was
suddenly cast on the floor.</p>
<p>The prince looked towards the window, and what
should he see sitting on the sill outside but a little
woman tapping the pane with a golden bodkin.</p>
<p>The prince jumped from his couch and opened
the window, and the little woman floated on the
moonbeams into the room and sat down on the
floor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are thinking of the Princess Ailinn,&#8221; said
the little woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never think of anyone else,&#8221; said the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said the little woman, &#8220;and it&#8217;s
because of your love for each other, and because her
mother was a friend to me in the days gone by,
that I have come here to try and help you; but
there is not much time for talking, the night
advances. At the bank below a boat awaits you.
Step into it and it will lead you to the mainland, and
when you reach it you will find before you a path
that will take you to the green fields of Erin and
the plains of Tara. I know you will have to face
danger. I know not what kind of danger; but
whatever it may be do not draw your sword before
you tread upon the mainland, for if you do you
shall never reach it, and the boat will come back
again to the floating island; and now go and may
luck go with you;&#8221; and saying this the little
woman climbed up the moonbeams and disappeared.</p>
<p>The prince left the palace and descended to the
lake, and there before him he saw a glistening boat;
he stepped into it, and the boat went on and on
beneath the moon, and at last he saw the mainland,
and he could trace a winding pathway going away
from the shore. The sight filled his heart with joy,
but suddenly the milk-white moonshine died away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
and looking up to the sky he saw the moon turning
fiery red, and the waters of the lake, shining like
silver a moment before, took a blood-red hue, and a
wind arose that stirred the waters, and they leaped
up against the little boat, tossing it from side to side.
While Cuglas was wondering at the change, he
heard a strange, unearthly noise ahead of him, and
a bristling monster, lifting its claws above the
water, in a moment was beside the boat and stuck
one of his claws in the left arm of the prince, and
pierced the flesh to the bone. Maddened by the
pain the prince drew his sword and chopped off
the monster&#8217;s claw. The monster disappeared
beneath the lake, and, as it did so, the colour of the
water changed, and the silver moonlight shone down
from the sky again, but the boat no longer went on
towards the mainland, but sped back towards the
floating island, while forth from the island came a
fleet of fairy boats to meet it, led by the shallop
of the fairy queen. The queen greeted the prince
as if she knew not of his attempted flight, and to
the music of the harps the fleet returned to the
palace.</p>
<p>The next day passed and the night came, and
again the prince was lying on the couch, thinking
of the Princess Ailinn, and again he saw the shadow
on the floor and heard the tapping against the
window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>And when he opened it the little woman slid into
the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You failed last night,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I come
to give you another chance. To-morrow the queen
must set out on a visit to her fairy kinsmen, who
dwell in the green hill near the plain of Tara; she
cannot take you with her, for if your feet once
touched the green grass that grows in the fruitful
fields of Erin, she could never bring you back again.
And so, when you find she has left the palace, go at
once into the banquet hall and look behind the
throne, and you will see a small door let down into
the ground. Pull this up and descend the steps
which you will see. Where they lead to I cannot
tell. What dangers may be before you I do not
know; but this I know, if you accept anything, no
matter what it is, from anyone you may meet on
your way, you shall not set foot on the soil of Erin.&#8221;</p>
<p>And having said this the little woman, rising
from the floor, floated out through the window.</p>
<p>The prince returned to his couch, and the next
morning, as soon as he heard the queen had left the
palace, he hastened to the banquet hall. He discovered
the door and descended the steps, and he
found himself in a gloomy and lonesome valley.
Jagged mountains, black as night, rose on either
side, and huge rocks seemed ready to topple down
upon him at every step. Through broken clouds a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
watery moon shed a faint, fitful light, that came
and went as the clouds, driven by a moaning wind,
passed over the valley.</p>
<p>Cuglas, nothing daunted, pushed on boldly until
a bank of cloud shut out completely the struggling
moon, and closing over the valley covered it like a
pall, leaving him in perfect darkness. At the same
moment the moaning wind died away, and with it
died away all sound. The darkness and the death-like
silence sent an icy chill to the heart of Cuglas.
He held his hand close to his eyes, but he saw it not.
He shouted that he might hear the sound of his own
voice, but he heard it not. He stamped his foot on
the rocky ground, but no sound was returned to him.
He rattled his sword in its brazen scabbard, but it
gave no answer back to him. His heart grew
colder and colder, when suddenly the cloud above
him was rent in a dozen places, and lightning flashed
through the valley, and the thunder rolled over
the echoing mountains. In the lurid glare of the
lightning Cuglas saw a hundred ghostly forms
sweeping towards him, uttering as they came
nearer and nearer shrieks so terrible that the
silence of death could more easily be borne.
Cuglas turned to escape, but they hemmed him
round, and pressed their clammy hands upon his
face.</p>
<p>With a yell of horror he drew his sword and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
slashed about him, and that very moment the
forms vanished, the thunder ceased, the dark
cloud passed, and the sun shone out as bright as
on a summer day, and then Cuglas knew the forms
he had seen were those of the wild people of the
glen.<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a></p>
<p>With renewed courage he pursued his way
through the valley, and after three or four windings
it took him out upon a sandy desert. He had no
sooner set foot upon the desert than he heard
behind him a crashing sound louder than thunder.
He looked around, and he saw that the walls of
mountain through which he had just passed had
fallen into the valley, and filled it up so that he
could no longer tell where it had been.</p>
<p>The sun was beating fiercely on the desert, and
the sands were almost as hot as burning cinders;
and as Cuglas advanced over them his body became
dried up, and his tongue clove to the roof of his
mouth, and when his thirst was at its height a
fountain of sparkling water sprang up in the burning
plain a few paces in front of him; but when he
came up quite close to it and stretched out his
parched hands to cool them in the limped waters,
the fountain vanished as suddenly as it appeared.
With great pain, and almost choking with heat and
thirst, he struggled on, and again the fountain
sprang up in front of him and moved before him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
almost within his reach. At last he came to the
end of the desert, and he saw a green hill up which
a pathway climbed; but as he came to the foot of
the hill, there, sitting right in his way, was a beautiful
fairy holding out towards him a crystal cup, over
the rim of which flowed water as clear as crystal.
Unable to resist the temptation, the prince seized
the cold, bright goblet, and drank the water. When
he did so his thirst vanished, but the fairy, and the
green hill, and the burning desert disappeared, and
he was standing in the forest behind the palace of
the fairy queen.</p>
<p>That evening the queen returned, and at the
feast she talked as gaily to the prince as if she
knew not of his attempt to leave the Floating
Island, and the prince spoke as gaily as he could to
her, although in his heart there was sadness when
he remembered that if he had only dashed away
the crystal cup, he would be at that moment in
the royal banquet hall of Tara, sitting beside the
Princess Ailinn.</p>
<p>And he thought the feast would never end; but it
was over at last, and the prince returned to his
apartments. And that night, as he lay on his
couch, he kept his eyes fixed upon the window; but
hours passed, and there was no sign of anyone. At
long last, and when he had given up all hope of
seeing her, he heard a tapping at the window, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
he got up and opened it, and the little woman
came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;You failed again to-day,&#8221; said she&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;failed just
at the very moment when you were about to step on
the green hills of Erin. I can give you only one
chance more. It will be your last. The queen
will go hunting in the morning. Join the hunt, and
when you are separated from the rest of the party
in the wood throw your reins upon your horse&#8217;s neck
and he will lead you to the edge of the lake. Then
cast this golden bodkin into the lake in the direction
of the mainland, and a golden bridge will be
thrown across, over which you can pass safely to
the fields of Erin; but take care and do not draw
your sword, for if you do your steed will bear you
back again to the Floating Island, and here you
must remain for ever.&#8221; Then handing the bodkin
to the prince, and saying good-bye, the little
woman disappeared.</p>
<p>The next morning the queen and the prince and
all the court went out to hunt, and a fleet white
deer started out before them, and the royal party
pressed after him in pursuit. The prince&#8217;s steed
outstripped the others, and when he was alone the
prince flung the reins upon his horse&#8217;s neck, and
before long he came to the edge of the lake.</p>
<p>Then the prince cast the bodkin on to the water,
and a golden bridge was thrown across to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
mainland, and the horse galloped on to it, and when
the prince was more than half-way he saw riding
towards him a champion wearing a silver helmet,
and carrying on his left arm a silver shield, and
holding in his right hand a gleaming sword. As
he came nearer he struck his shield with his sword
and challenged the prince to battle. The prince&#8217;s
sword almost leaped out of its scabbard at the
martial sound, and, like a true knight of Tara, he
dashed against his foe, and swinging his sword
above his head, with one blow he clove the silver
helmet, and the strange warrior reeled from his
horse and fell upon the golden bridge. The prince,
content with this achievement, spurred his horse
to pass the fallen champion, but the horse refused
to stir, and the bridge broke in two almost at his
feet, and the part of it between him and the mainland
disappeared beneath the lake, carrying with
it the horse and the body of the champion, and
before the prince could recover from his surprise,
his steed wheeled round and was galloping back,
and when he reached the land he rushed through
the forest, and the prince was not able to pull him
up until he came to the palace door.</p>
<p>All that night the prince lay awake on his couch
with his eyes fixed upon the window, but no
shadow fell upon the floor, and there was no
tapping at the pane, and with a heavy heart he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
joined the hunting party in the morning. And
day followed day, and his heart was sadder and
sadder, and found no pleasure in the joys and
delights of fairyland. And when all in the palace
were at rest he used to roam through the forest,
always thinking of the Princess Ailinn, and hoping
against hope that the little woman would come
again to him, but at last he began to despair of ever
seeing her. It chanced one night he rambled
so far that he found himself on the verge of the
lake, at the very spot from which the golden
bridge had been thrown across the waters, and as
he gazed wistfully upon them a boat shot up and
came swiftly to the bank, and who should he see
sitting in the stern but the little woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Cuglas, Cuglas,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I gave you
three chances, and you failed in all of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have borne the pain inflicted by the
monster&#8217;s claw,&#8221; said Cuglas. &#8220;I should have
borne the thirst on the sandy desert, and dashed
the crystal cup untasted from the fairy&#8217;s hand;
but I could never have faced the nobles and chiefs
of Erin if I had refused to meet the challenge of
the battle champion on the golden bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you would have been no true knight of
Erin, and you would not have been worthy of the
wee girl who loves you, the bonny Princess Ailinn,
if you had refused to meet it,&#8221; said the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
woman; &#8220;but for all that you can never return to
the fair hills of Erin. But cheer up, Cuglas, there
are mossy ways and forest paths and nestling
bowers in fairyland. Lonely they are, I know, in
your eyes now,&#8221; said the little woman; &#8220;but
maybe,&#8221; she added, with a laugh as musical as the
ripple on a streamlet when summer is in the air,
&#8220;maybe you won&#8217;t always think them so lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;ll forget Ailinn for the fairy queen,&#8221;
said Cuglas, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anything of the kind,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what do you mean?&#8221; said the prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean what I mean,&#8221; said the little woman.
&#8220;But I can&#8217;t stop here all night talking to you:
and, indeed, it is in your bed you ought to be
yourself. So now good night; and I have no more
to say, except that perhaps, if you happen to be
here this night week at this very hour, when the
moon will be on the waters, you will see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;. But
no matter what you will see,&#8221; said she; &#8220;I
must be off.&#8221;</p>
<p>And before the prince could say another word
the boat sped away from the bank, and he was alone.
He went back to the palace, and he fell asleep that
night only to dream of the Princess Ailinn.</p>
<p>As for the princess, she was pining away in the
palace of Tara, the colour had fled from her cheeks,
and her eyes, which had been once so bright they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
would have lighted darkness like a star, lost nearly
all their lustre, and the king&#8217;s leeches could do
nothing for her, and at last they gave up all hope,
and the king and queen of Erin and the ladies of
the court watched her couch by night and by day
sadly waiting for her last hour.</p>
<p>At length one day, when the sun was shining
brightly over Tara&#8217;s plain, and its light, softened
by the intervening curtains, was falling in the sick
chamber, the royal watchers noticed a sweet change
coming over the face of the princess; the bloom of
love and youth were flushing on her cheeks, and
from her eyes shone out the old, soft, tender light,
and they began to hope she was about to be restored
to them, when suddenly the room was in darkness
as if the night had swept across the sky, and blotted
out the sun. Then they heard the sound of fairy
music, and over the couch where the princess lay
they beheld a gleam of golden light, but only for a
moment; and again there was perfect darkness,
and the fairy music ceased. Then, as suddenly as
it came the darkness vanished, the softened sunlight
once more filled the chamber, and rested upon
the couch; but the couch was empty, and the
royal watchers, looking at each other, said in
whispers: &#8220;The fairies have carried away the
Princess Ailinn to fairyland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that very day the prince roamed by himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
through the forest, counting the hours until the day
would fade in the sky and the moon come climbing
up, and at last, when it was shining full above the
waters, he went down to the verge of the lake, and he
looked out over the gleaming surface watching for
the vision promised by the little woman. But he
could see nothing, and was about to turn away
when he heard the faint sound of fairy music.
He listened and listened, and the sound came
nearer and clearer, and away in the distance, like
drops of glistening water breaking the level of the
lake, he saw a fleet of fairy boats, and he thought
it was the fairy queen sailing in the moonlight.
And it was the fairy queen, and soon he was able to
recognise the royal shallop leading the others, and
as it came close to the bank he saw the little woman
sitting in the prow between the little harpers, and
at the stern was the fairy queen, and by her side
the lady of his heart, the Princess Ailinn. In a
second the boat was against the bank, and the
princess in his arms. And he kissed her again
and again.</p>
<p>&#8220;And have you never a kiss for me,&#8221; said the
little woman, tapping his hand with the little gold
bodkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;A kiss and a dozen,&#8221; said Cuglas, as he caught
the little fairy up in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fie, Cuglas,&#8221; said the queen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the princess isn&#8217;t one bit jealous,&#8221; said the
little woman. &#8220;Are you, Ailinn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I am not,&#8221; said Ailinn.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you should not be,&#8221; said the fairy queen,
&#8220;for never lady yet had truer knight than Cuglas.
I loved him, and I love him dearly. I lured him
here hoping that in the delights of fairyland he
might forget you. It was all in vain. I know
now that there is one thing no fairy power above
or below the stars, or beneath the waters, can ever
subdue, and that is love. And here together
forever shall you and Cuglas dwell, where old age
shall never come upon you, and where pain or
sorrow or sickness are unknown.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Cuglas never returned to the fair hills of
Erin, and ages passed away since the morning he
followed the hounds into the fatal cave, but his
story was remembered by the firesides, and sometimes,
even yet, the herdboy watching his cattle
in the fields hears the tuneful cry of hounds, and
follows it till it leads him to a darksome cave, and
as fearfully he listens to the sound becoming
fainter and fainter he hears the clatter of hoofs
over the stony floor, and to this day the cave bears
the name of the prince who entered it never to
return. <span class="inlinenote">[Footnote: <i>Uaimh Belaigh Conglais</i>, the cave of the road of Cuglas&ndash;&ndash;now

<a name='THE_HUNTSMANS_SON' id='THE_HUNTSMANS_SON'></a>
<h2>THE HUNTSMAN&#8217;S SON.</h2>
</div>
<p>A long, long time ago there lived in a little hut on
the borders of a great forest a huntsman and his
wife and son. From his earliest years the boy,
whose name was Fergus, used to hunt with his
father in the forest, and he grew up strong and
active, sure and swift-footed as a deer, and as
free and fearless as the wind. He was tall and
handsome; as supple as a mountain ash, his lips
were as red as its berries; his eyes were as blue as
the skies in spring; and his hair fell down over his
shoulders like a shower of gold. His heart was as
light as a bird&#8217;s, and no bird was fonder of green
woods and waving branches. He had lived since
his birth in the hut in the forest, and had never
wished to leave it, until one winter night a wandering
minstrel sought shelter there, and paid for his
night&#8217;s lodging with songs of love and battle.
Ever since that night Fergus pined for another
life. He no longer found joy in the music of the
hounds or in the cries of the huntsmen in forest
glades. He yearned for the chance of battle,
and the clang of shields, and the fierce
shouts of fighting warriors, and he spent
all his spare hours practising on the harp and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
learning the use of arms, for in those days the
bravest warriors were also bards. In this way the
spring and summer and autumn passed; and when
the winter came again it chanced that on a stormy
night, when thunder was rattling through the
forest, smiting the huge oaks and hurling them
crashing to the earth, Fergus lay awake thinking
of his present lot, and wondering what the future
might have in store for him. The lightning was
playing around the hut, and every now and then
a flash brightened up the interior.</p>
<p>After a peal, louder than any which had preceded
it, Fergus heard three loud knocks at the door. He
called out to his parents that some one was knocking.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is so,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;open at once;
this is no night to keep a poor wanderer outside
our door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fergus did as he was bidden, and as he opened
the door a flash of lightning showed him, standing
at the threshold, a little wizened old man with a
small harp under his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, and welcome,&#8221; said Fergus, and the
little man stepped into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wild night, neighbours,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed, a wild night,&#8221; said the huntsman
and his wife, who had got up and dressed themselves;
&#8220;and sorry we are we have no better shelter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
or better fare to offer you, but we give you the best
we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A king cannot do more than his best,&#8221; said
the little man.</p>
<p>The huntsman&#8217;s wife lit the fire, and soon the
pine logs flashed up into a blaze, and made the hut
bright and warm. She then brought forth a peggin
of milk and a cake of barley-bread.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be hungry, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hungry I am,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but I wouldn&#8217;t ask
for better fare than this if I were in the king&#8217;s
palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you kindly, sir,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and I hope
you will eat enough, and that it will do you good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And while you are eating your supper,&#8221; said
the huntsman, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you a bed of fresh
rushes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t put yourself to that trouble,&#8221; said the
little man. &#8220;When I have done my supper I&#8217;ll
lie down here by the fire, if it is pleasing to you,
and I&#8217;ll sleep like a top until morning. And now
go back to your beds and leave me to myself, and
maybe some time when you won&#8217;t be expecting
it I&#8217;ll do a good turn for your kindness to the poor
wayfarer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s no kindness at all,&#8221; said the huntsman&#8217;s
wife. &#8220;It would be a queer thing if an Irish
cabin would not give shelter and welcome in a wild
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
night like this. So good night, now, and we hope
you will sleep well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; said the little man, &#8220;and may
you and yours never sup sorrow until your dying
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The huntsman and his wife and Fergus then went
back to their beds, and the little man, having
finished his supper, curled himself up by the fire,
and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>About an hour after a loud clap of thunder
awakened Fergus, and before it had died away he
heard three knocks at the door. He aroused his
parents and told them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up at once,&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;this is no
night to keep a stranger outside our door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fergus rose and opened the door, and a flash of
lightning showed him a little old woman, with a
shuttle in her hand, standing outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, and welcome,&#8221; said he, and the little
old woman stepped into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessings be on them who give welcome to a
wanderer on a wild night like this,&#8221; said the old
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who wouldn&#8217;t give welcome on a night
like this?&#8221; said the huntsman&#8217;s wife, coming
forward with a peggin of milk and a barley cake
in her hand, &#8220;and sorry we are we have not better
fare to offer you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Enough is as good as a feast,&#8221; said the little
woman, &#8220;and now go back to your beds and leave
me to myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till I shake down a bed of rushes for you,&#8221;
said the huntsman&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind the rushes,&#8221; said the little woman;
&#8220;go back to your beds. I&#8217;ll sleep here by the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>The huntsman&#8217;s wife went to bed, and the little
old woman, having eaten her supper, lay down by
the fire, and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>About an hour later another clap of thunder
startled Fergus. Again he heard three knocks at
the door. He roused his parents, but he did not
wait for orders from them. He opened the door,
and a flash of lightning showed him outside the
threshold a low-sized, shaggy, wild-looking horse.
And Fergus knew it was the Pooka, the wild horse
of the mountains. Bold as Fergus was, his heart
beat quickly as he saw fire issuing from the Pooka&#8217;s
nostrils. But, banishing fear, he cried out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, and welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome you are,&#8221; said the huntsman, &#8220;and
sorry we are that we have not better shelter or
fare to offer you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t wish a better welcome,&#8221; said the
Pooka, as he came over near the fire and sat down
on his haunches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you would like a little bit of this, Master
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
Pooka,&#8221; said the huntsman&#8217;s wife, as she offered
him a barley cake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never tasted anything sweeter in my life,&#8221;
said the Pooka, crunching it between his teeth,
&#8220;and now if you can give me a sup of milk, I&#8217;ll
want for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The huntsman&#8217;s wife brought him a peggin of
milk. When he had drunk it, &#8220;Now,&#8221; says the
Pooka, &#8220;go back to your beds, and I&#8217;ll curl myself
up by the fire and sleep like a top till morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>And soon everybody in the hut was fast asleep.</p>
<p>When the morning came the storm had gone,
and the sun was shining through the windows of
the hut. At the song of the lark Fergus got up,
and no one in the world was ever more surprised
than he when he saw no sign of the little old man,
or the little old woman, or the wild horse of the
mountains. His parents were also surprised, and
they all thought that they must have been dreaming
until they saw the empty peggins around the
fire and some pieces of broken bread; and they
did not know what to think of it all.</p>
<p>From that day forward the desire grew stronger
in the heart of Fergus for a change of life; and one
day he told his parents that he was resolved to seek
his fortune. He said he wished to be a soldier,
and that he would set out for the king&#8217;s palace,
and try to join the ranks of the Feni.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>About a week afterwards he took leave of his
parents, and having received their blessing he
struck out for the road that led to the palace of
the High King of Erin. He arrived there just at
the time when the great captain of the Fenian host
was recruiting his battalions, which had been
thinned in recent battle.</p>
<p>The manly figure of Fergus, his gallant bearing,
and handsome face, all told in his favour. But
before he could be received into the Fenian ranks
he had to prove that he could play the harp like a
bard, that he could contend with staff and shield
against nine Fenian warriors, that he could run
with plaited hair through the tangled forest without
loosening a single hair, and that in his course he
could jump over trees as high as his head, and
stoop under trees as low as his knee, and that he
could run so lightly that the rotten <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'twigg'">twigs</ins> should
not break under his feet. Fergus proved equal to
all the tests, thanks to the wandering minstrel who
taught him the use of the harp, to his own brave
heart, and to his forest training. He was enrolled
in the second battalion of the Feni, and before long
he was its bravest and ablest champion.</p>
<p>At that very time it happened that the niece of
the High King of Erin was staying with the king
and queen in their palace at Tara. The princess
was the loveliest lady in all the land. She was as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
proud as she was beautiful. The princes and
chieftains of Erin in vain sought her hand in
marriage. From Alba and Spain, and the far-off
isles of Greece, kings came to woo her. From the
northern lands came vikings in stately galleys with
brazen prows, whose oarsmen tore the white foam
from the emerald seas as they swept towards the
Irish coasts. But the lady had vowed she would
wed with no one except a battle champion who
could excel in music the chief bard of the High
King of Erin; who could outstrip on his steed in
the great race of Tara the white steed of the plains;
and who could give her as a wedding robe a garment
of all the colours of the rainbow, so finely spun that
when folded up it would fit in the palm of her small
white hand. To fulfil these three conditions was
impossible for all her suitors, and it seemed as if
the loveliest lady of the land should go unmarried
to her grave.</p>
<p>It chanced that once, on a day when the Fenian
battalions were engaged in a hurling-match, Fergus
beheld the lady watching the match from her sunny
bower. He no sooner saw her than he fell over
head and ears in love with her, and he thought of
her by night, and he thought of her by day, and
believing that his love was hopeless, he often
wished he had never left his forest-home.</p>
<p>The great fair of Tara<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> was coming on, and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
the Feni were busy from morning till night practising
feats of arms and games, in order to take
part in the contests to be held during the fair.
And Fergus, knowing that the princess would be
present, determined to do his best to win the
prizes which were to be contended for before the
ladies&#8217; eyes.</p>
<p>The fair began on the 1st of August, but for a
whole week before the five great roads of Erin were
thronged with people of all sorts. Princes and
warriors on their steeds, battle champions in their
chariots, harpers in hundreds, smiths with gleaming
spears and shields and harness for battle steeds
and chariots; troops of men and boys leading racehorses;
jewellers with gold drinking-horns, and
brooches, and pins, and ear-rings, and costly gems
of all kinds, and chess-boards of silver and gold,
and golden and silver chessmen in bags of woven
brass; dyers with their many-coloured fabrics;
bands of jugglers; drovers goading on herds of
cattle; shepherds driving their sheep; huntsmen
with spoils of the chase; dwellers in the lakes or by
the fish-abounding rivers with salmon and speckled
trout; and countless numbers of peasants on horseback
and on foot, all wending their way to the great
meeting-place by the mound, which a thousand
years before had been raised over the grave of the
great queen. For there the fair was to be held.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>On the opening day the High King, attended by
the four kings of Erin, set out from the palace,
and with them went the queen and the ladies of the
court in sparkling chariots. The princess rode in
the chariot with the high queen, under an awning
made of the wings of birds, to protect them from
the rays of the sun. Following the queen were the
court ladies in other chariots, under awnings of
purple or of yellow silk. Then came the brehons,
the great judges of the land, and the chief bards of
the high court of Tara, and the Druids, crowned
with oak leaves, and carrying wands of divination
in their hands.</p>
<p>When the royal party reached the ground it
took its place in enclosures right up against the
monumental mound. The High King sat with the
four kings of Erin, all wearing their golden helmets,
for they wore their diadems in battle only. In an
enclosure next the king&#8217;s sat the queen and the
princess and all the ladies of the court. At either
side of the royal pavilions were others for the
dames and ladies and nobles and chiefs of different
degrees, forming part of a circle on the plain, and
the stands and benches for the people were so
arranged as to complete the circle, and in the
round green space within it, so that all might
hear and see, the contests were to take place.</p>
<p>At a signal from the king, who was greeted with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
a thunderous cheer, the heralds rode round the
circle, and having struck their sounding shields
three times with their swords, they made a solemn
proclamation of peace. Then was sung by all the
assembled bards, to the accompaniment of their
harps, the chant in honour of the mighty dead.
When this was ended, again the heralds struck
their shields, and the contests began. The first
contest was the contest of spear-throwing between
the champions of the seven battalions of the Feni.
When the seven champions took their places in
front of the royal enclosure, everyone, even the
proud princess, was struck by the manly beauty
and noble bearing of Fergus.</p>
<p>The champions poised their spears, and at a
stroke from the heralds upon their shields the seven
spears sped flashing through the air. They all
struck the ground, shafts up, and it was seen that
two were standing side by side in advance of the
rest, one belonged to Fergus, the other to the great
chief, Oscar. The contest for the prize then lay
between Oscar and Fergus, and when they stood
in front of the king, holding their spears aloft,
every heart was throbbing with excitement. Once
more the heralds struck their shields, and, swifter
than the lightning&#8217;s flash, forth went the spears,
and when Fergus&#8217;s spear was seen shivering in the
ground a full length ahead of the great chief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
Oscar&#8217;s, the air was shaken by a wild cheer that
was heard far beyond the plains of Tara. And as
Fergus approached the high king to receive the
prize the cheers were renewed. But Fergus thought
more of the winsome glance of the princess than
he did of the prize or the sounding cheers. And
Princess Maureen was almost sorry for her vow,
for her heart was touched by the beauty of the
Fenian champion.</p>
<p>Other contests followed, and the day passed,
and the night fell, and while the Fenian warriors
were revelling in their camps the heart of Fergus,
victor as he was, was sad and low. He escaped
from his companions, and stole away to his native
forest, for&ndash;&ndash;</p>

</div>
<p>And as he lay under the spreading branches,
watching the stars glancing through the leaves,
and listening to the slumb&#8217;rous murmur of the
waters, a strange peace came over him.</p>
<p>But in the camp which he had left, and in the
vast multitude on the plains of Tara, there was
stir and revelry, and babbling speculation as to
the contest of to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;the contest which was
to decide whether the chief bard of Erin was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
hold his own against all comers, or yield the palm.
For rumour said that a great Skald had come
from the northern lands to compete with the Irish
bard.</p>
<p>At last, over the Fenian camp, and over the
great plain and the multitude that thronged it,
sleep fell, clothing them with a silence as deep as
that which dwelt in the forest, where, dreaming of
the princess, Fergus lay. He awoke at the first
notes of the birds, but though he felt he ought to
go back to his companions and be witness of the
contest which might determine whether the princess
was to be another&#8217;s bride, his great love and his
utter despair of winning her so oppressed him that
he lay as motionless as a broken reed. He scarcely
heard the music of the birds, and paid no heed to
the murmur of the brook rushing by his feet. The
crackling of branches near him barely disturbed
him, but when a shadow fell across his eyes he
looked up gloomily, and saw, or thought he saw,
someone standing before him. He started up, and
who should he see but the little wizened old man
who found shelter in his father&#8217;s hut on the stormy
night.</p>

&#8220;He started up, and who should he see but a little wizened old man&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;p. 136.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;This is a nice place for a battle champion to
be. This is a nice place for <i>you</i> to be on the day
which is to decide who will be the successful suitor
of the princess.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it to me,&#8221; said Fergus, &#8220;who is to
win her since I cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; said the little man, &#8220;the night
you opened the door for me, that the time might
come when I might be able to do a good turn for
you and yours. The time has come. Take this
harp, and my luck go with you, and in the contest
of the bards to-day you&#8217;ll reap the reward of the
kindness you did when you opened your door to
the poor old wayfarer in the midnight storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man handed his harp to Fergus and
disappeared as swiftly as the wind that passes
through the leaves.</p>
<p>Fergus, concealing the harp under his silken
cloak, reached the camp before his comrades had
aroused themselves from sleep.</p>
<p>At length the hour arrived when the great contest
was to take place.</p>
<p>The king gave the signal, and as the chief bard of
Erin was seen ascending the mound in front of
the royal enclosures he was greeted with a roar
of cheers, but at the first note of his harp silence
like that of night fell on the mighty gathering.</p>
<p>As he moved his fingers softly over the strings
every heart was hushed, filled with a sense of balmy
rest. The lark soaring and singing above his head
paused mute and motionless in the still air, and no
sound was heard over the spacious plain save the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
dreamy music. Then the bard struck another key,
and a gentle sorrow possessed the hearts of his
hearers, and unbidden tears gathered to their eyes.
Then, with bolder hand, he swept his fingers across
his lyre, and all hearts were moved to joy and
pleasant laughter, and eyes that had been dimmed
by tears sparkled as brightly as running waters
dancing in the sun. When the last notes had died
away a cheer arose, loud as the voice of the storm
in the glen when the live thunder is revelling on the
mountain tops. As soon as the bard had descended
the mound the Skald from the northern lands took
his place, greeted by cries of welcome from a
hundred thousand throats. He touched his harp,
and in the perfect silence was heard the strains of
the mermaid&#8217;s song, and through it the pleasant
ripple of summer waters on the pebbly beach.
Then the theme was changed, and on the air was
borne the measured sweep of countless oars and
the swish of waters around the prows of contending
galleys, and the breezy voices of the sailors and the
sea-bird&#8217;s cry. Then his theme was changed to
the mirth and laughter of the banquet-hall, the
clang of meeting drinking-horns, and songs of
battle. When the last strain ended, from the
mighty host a great shout went up, loud as the
roar of winter billows breaking in the hollows of
the shore; and men knew not whom to declare the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
victor, the chief bard of Erin or the Skald of the
northern lands.</p>
<p>In the height of the debate the cry arose that
another competitor had ascended the mound, and
there standing in view of all was Fergus, the
huntsman&#8217;s son. All eyes were fastened upon him,
but no one looked so eagerly as the princess.</p>
<p>He touched his harp with gentle fingers, and a
sound low and soft as a faint summer breeze
passing through forest trees stole out, and then
was heard the rustle of birds through the branches,
and the dreamy murmur of waters lost in deepest
woods, and all the fairy echoes whispering when
the leaves are motionless in the noonday heat;
then followed notes cool and soft as the drip of
summer showers on the parched grass, and then
the song of the blackbird, sounding as clearly as it
sounds in long silent spaces of the evening, and then
in one sweet jocund burst the multitudinous voices
that hail the breaking of the morn. And the lark,
singing and soaring above the minstrel, sank mute
and motionless upon his shoulder, and from all the
leafy woods the birds came thronging out and
formed a fluttering canopy above his head.</p>
<p>When the bard ceased playing no shout arose
from the mighty multitude, for the strains of his
harp, long after its chords were stilled, held their
hearts spell-bound.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>And when he had passed away from the mound
of contest all knew there was no need to declare
the victor.<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> And all were glad the comely Fenian
champion had maintained the supremacy of the
bards of Erin. But there was one heart sad, the
heart of the princess; and now she wished more
than ever that she had never made her hateful
vow.</p>
<p>Other contests went on, but Fergus took no
interest in them; and once more he stole away to
the forest glade. His heart was sorrowful, for he
thought of the great race of the morning, and he
knew that he could not hope to compete with the
rider of the white steed of the plains. And as he
lay beneath the spreading branches during the
whole night long his thoughts were not of the
victory he had won, but of the princess, who was
as far away from him as ever. He passed the night
without sleep, and when the morning came he rose
and walked aimlessly through the woods.</p>
<p>A deer starting from a thicket reminded him of
the happy days of his boyhood, and once more the
wish came back to him that he had never left his
forest home. As his eyes followed the deer wistfully,
suddenly he started in amazement. The deer
vanished from view, and in his stead was the wild
horse of the mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I&#8217;d do you a good turn,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Pooka, &#8220;for the kindness you and yours did me
on that wild winter&#8217;s night. The day is passing.
You have no time to lose. The white steed of the
plains is coming to the starting-post. Jump on
my back, and remember, &#8216;Faint heart never won
fair lady.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>In half a second Fergus was bestride the Pooka,
whose coat of shaggy hair became at once as glossy
as silk, and just at the very moment when the king
was about to declare there was no steed to compete
with the white steed of the plains, the Pooka with
Fergus upon his back, galloped up in front of the
royal enclosure. When the people saw the champion
a thunderous shout rose up that startled the
birds in the skies, and sent them flying to the
groves.</p>
<p>And in the ladies&#8217; enclosure was a rustle of
many-coloured scarves waving in the air. At the
striking of the shields the contending steeds rushed
from the post with the swiftness of a swallow&#8217;s
flight. But before the white steed of the plains
had gone half-way round, Fergus and the wild
horse of the mountains had passed the winning
post, greeted by such cheers as had never before
been heard on the plains of Tara.</p>
<p>Fergus heard the cheers, but scarcely heeded
them, for his heart went out through his eyes that
were fastened on the princess, and a wild hope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
stirred him that his glance was not ungrateful to
the loveliest lady of the land.</p>
<p>And the princess was sad and sorry for her vow,
for she believed that it was beyond the power of
Fergus to bring her a robe of all the colours of the
rainbow, so subtly woven as to fit in the palm of
her soft, white hand.</p>
<p>That night also Fergus went to the forest, not
too sad, because there was a vague hope in his
heart that had never been there before. He lay
down under the branches, with his feet towards the
rustling waters, and the smiles of the princess
gilded his slumbers, as the rays of the rising sun
gild the glades of the forest; and when the morning
came he was scarcely surprised when before him
appeared the little old woman with the shuttle he
had welcomed on the winter&#8217;s night.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you have won her already,&#8221; said the
little woman. &#8220;And so you have, too; her heart
is all your own, and I&#8217;m half inclined to think
that my trouble will be thrown away, for if you
had never a wedding robe to give her, she&#8217;d rather
have you this minute than all the kings of Erin,
or than all the other princes and kings and chieftains
in the whole world. But you and your father
and mother were kind to me on a wild winter&#8217;s
night, and I&#8217;d never see your mother&#8217;s son without
a wedding robe fit for the greatest princess that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
ever set nations to battle for her beauty. So go
and pluck me a handful of wild forest flowers, and
I&#8217;ll weave out of them a wedding robe with all the
colours of the rainbow, and one that will be as
sweet and as fragrant as the ripe, red lips of the
princess herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fergus, with joyous heart, culled the flowers,
and brought them to the little old woman.</p>
<p>In the twinkling of an eye she wove with her
little shuttle a wedding robe, with all the colours
of the rainbow, as light as the fairy dew, as soft
as the hand of the princess, as fragrant as her
little red mouth, and so small that it would pass
through the eye of a needle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go now, Fergus,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and may luck go
with you; but, in the days of your greatness and
of the glory which will come to you when you are
wedded to the princess, be as kind, and have as
open a heart and as open a door for the poor as
you had when you were only a poor huntsman&#8217;s
son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fergus took the robe and went towards Tara.
It was the last day of the fair, and all the contests
were over, and the bards were about to chant the
farewell strains to the memory of the great queen.
But before the chief bard could ascend the mound,
Fergus, attended by a troop of Fenian warriors on
their steeds, galloped into the enclosure, and rode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
up in front of the queen&#8217;s pavilion. Holding up
the glancing and many-coloured robe, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;O Queen and King of Erin! I claim the princess
for my bride. You, O king, have decided that I
have won the prize in the contest of the bards;
that I have won the prize in the race against the
white steed of the plains; it is for the princess to say
if the robe which I give her will fit in the hollow
of her small white hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;You are victor in the
contests; let the princess declare if you have
fulfilled the last condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The princess took the robe from Fergus, closed
her fingers over it, so that no vestige of it was
seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, O king!&#8221; said she, &#8220;he has fulfilled the
last condition; but before ever he had fulfilled a
single one of them, my heart went out to the
comely champion of the Feni. I was willing then,
I am ready now, to become the bride of the huntsman&#8217;s
son.&#8221;</p>

<h3><i>The Birds of the Mystic Lake.</i></h3>

<p>The incident of the birds coming to the mystic lake is taken
from &#8220;The Voyage of Maildun,&#8221; a translation of which is
given in Joyce&#8217;s Old Celtic Romances. The operations of the
birds were witnessed by Maildun and his companions, who, in
the course of their wanderings, had arrived at the Isle of the
Mystic Lake. One of Maildun&#8217;s companions, Diuran, on seeing
the wonder, said to the others: &#8220;Let us bathe in the lake,
and we shall obtain a renewal of our youth like the birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they said: &#8220;Not so, for the bird has left the poison of
his old age and decay in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Diuran</i>, however, plunged in, and swam about for some
time; after which he took a little of the water and mixed it
in his mouth, and in the end he swallowed a small quantity.
He then came out perfectly sound and whole, and remained
so ever after as long as he lived. But none of the others
ventured in.</p>

<p>The return of the birds in the character of the cormorants
of the western seas and guardians of the lake does not occur
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
in the old tale. The oldest copy of the voyage is in the book
of &#8220;The Dun Cow&#8221; (about the year 1100). O&#8217;Curry says the
voyage was undertaken about the year 700. It was made by
Maildun in search of pirates who had slain his father. The
story is full of fancy.

<h3><i>The House in the Lake.</i></h3>

<p>In the Irish annals lake dwellings, which were formerly
common in Ireland, are called <i>crannogs</i>, from crann, a tree,
either because of the timber framework of which the island
was formed or of the wooden huts erected thereon.</p>

<p>Some <i>crannogs</i> appear to have been veritable islands, the
only means of communication with the land being canoes.
Remains of these have been frequently found near the dwelling,
in some instances alongside the landing stage, as if sunk at
their moorings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Favourite sites for <i>crannogs</i> were marshes, small loughs
surrounded by woods and large sheets of water. As providing
good fishing grounds the entrance to or exit of a stream from
a lake was eagerly selected.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Lake Dwellings of Ireland,&#8221;

<h3><i>Brian&#8217;s Water-dress.</i></h3>

<p>Brian, Ur, and Urcar, the three sons of Turenn, were
Dedanaan chiefs. They slew Kian, the father of Luga of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Long Arms, who was grandson of Balor of the Evil Eye.
Luga imposed an extraordinary eric fine on the sons of Turenn,
part of which was &#8220;the cooking-spit of the women of Fincara.&#8221;
For a quarter of a year Brian and his brothers sailed hither
and thither over the wide ocean, landing on many shores,
seeking tidings of the Island of Fincara. At last they met a
very old man, who told them that the island lay deep down
in the waters, having been sunk beneath the waves by a spell
in times long past.</p>

<p>Then Brian put on his water-dress, with his helmet of
transparent crystal on his head, telling his brothers to wait
his return. He leaped over the side of the ship, and sank at
once out of sight. He walked about for a fortnight down in
the green salt sea, seeking for the Island of Fincara, and at
last he found it.</p>

<p>His brothers waited for him in the same spot the whole
time, and when he came not they began to fear he would
return no more. At last they were about to leave the place,
when they saw the glitter of his crystal helmet deep down in
the water, and immediately after he came to the surface with
the cooking-spit in his hand.&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Old Celtic Romances&#8221;

<h3><i>Liban the Mermaid.</i></h3>

<p>Liban was the daughter of Ecca, son of Mario, King of
Munster. Ecca, having conquered the lordship of the half of
Ulster, settled down with his people in the plain of the Grey
Copse, which is now covered by the waters of Lough Necca,
now Lough Neagh. A magic well had sprung up in the plain,
and not being properly looked after by the woman in charge
of it, its waters burst forth over the plain, drowning Ecca
and nearly all his family. Liban, although swept away like
the others, was not drowned. She lived for a whole year,
with her lap-dog, in a chamber beneath the lake, and God
protected her from the water. At the end of that time she
was weary, and when she saw the speckled salmon swimming
and playing all round her, she prayed to be changed into a
salmon that she might swim with the others through the
green, salt sea. Her prayer was granted; she took the shape
of a salmon, except her face and breast, which did not change.
And her lap-dog was changed into an otter, and attended her
afterwards whithersoever she went as long as she lived in the
sea.</p>

<p>It is nearly eight hundred years ago since the story was
transcribed from some old authority into the Book of the
Dun Cow, the oldest manuscript of Gaelic literature we possess.&ndash;&ndash;Joyce&#8217;s

<h3><i>The Fairy Tree of Dooros.</i></h3>

<p>The forest of Dooros was in the district of Hy Fiera of the
Moy (now the barony of Tireragh, in Sligo).</p>

<p>On a certain occasion the Dedanns, returning from a hurling
match with the Feni, passed through the forest, carrying with
them for food during the journey crimson nuts, and arbutus
apples, and scarlet quicken-berries, which they had brought
from the Land of Promise. One of the quicken-berries
dropped on the earth, and the Dedanns passed on not heeding.</p>

<p>From this berry a great quicken-tree sprang up, which had
the virtues of the quicken-trees that grow in fairyland. Its
berries had the taste of honey, and those who ate of them
felt a cheerful glow, as if they had drunk of wine or old mead,
and if a man were even a hundred years old he returned to
the age of thirty as soon as he had eaten three of them.</p>

<p>The Dedanns having heard of this tree, and not wishing
that anyone should eat of the berries but themselves, sent a
giant of their own people to guard it, namely, Sharvan the
Surly, of Lochlann.&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Grania,&#8221;

<p>&#8220;Cuglas was the son of Donn Desa, King of Leinster, and
master of the hounds to the monarch Conair&eacute; Mor. Having
one day followed the chase from Tara to this road, the chase
suddenly disappeared in a cave, into which he followed, and
was <i>never seen after</i>. Hence the cave was called <i>Uaimh
Bealach Conglais</i>, or the cave of the road of Cuglas (now
Baltinglass, in the County of Wicklow). It is about this cave,
nevertheless, that so many of our pretended Irish antiquarians
have written so much nonsense in connection with some
imaginary pagan worship to which they gravely assure the
world, on <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'entymological'">etymological</ins> authority, the spot was devoted.
The authority for the legend of Cuglas is the <i>Dinnoean Chus</i>
